@article{Mainz.2015,
 abstract = {Introduction. P. aeruginosa is the primary cause for pulmonary destruction and premature death in cystic fibrosis (CF). Therefore, prevention of airway colonization with the pathogen, ubiquitously present in water, is essential. Infection of CF patients with P. aeruginosa after dentist treatment was proven and dental unit waterlines were identified as source, suggesting prophylactic measures. For their almost regular sinonasal involvement, CF patients often require otorhinolaryngological (ORL) attendance. Despite some fields around ORL-procedures with comparable risk for acquisition of P. aeruginosa, such CF cases have not yet been reported. We present four CF patients, who primarily acquired P. aeruginosa around ORL surgery, and one around dentist treatment. Additionally, we discuss risks and preventive strategies for CF patients undergoing ORL-treatment. Perils include contact to pathogen-carriers in waiting rooms, instrumentation, suction, drilling, and flushing fluid, when droplets containing pathogens can be nebulized. Postsurgery mucosal damage and debridement impair sinonasal mucociliary clearance, facilitating pathogen proliferation and infestation. Therefore, sinonasal surgery and dentist treatment of CF patients without chronic P. aeruginosa colonization must be linked to repeated microbiological assessment. Further studies must elaborate whether all CF patients undergoing ORL-surgery require antipseudomonal prophylaxis, including nasal lavages containing antibiotics. Altogether, this underestimated risk requires structured prevention protocols.},

@article{Lang.2014,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Clinical validation of laboratory toothbrushing tests has important advantages. It was, therefore, the aim to demonstrate correlation of tooth cleaning efficiency of a new robot brushing simulation technique with clinical plaque removal.

METHODS

Clinical programme: 27 subjects received dental cleaning prior to 3-day-plaque-regrowth-interval. Plaque was stained, photographically documented and scored using planimetrical index. Subjects brushed teeth 33-47 with three techniques (horizontal, rotating, vertical), each for 20s buccally and for 20s orally in 3 consecutive intervals. The force was calibrated, the brushing technique was video supported. Two different brushes were randomly assigned to the subject. Robot programme: Clinical brushing programmes were transfered to a 6-axis-robot. Artificial teeth 33-47 were covered with plaque-simulating substrate. All brushing techniques were repeated 7 times, results were scored according to clinical planimetry. All data underwent statistical analysis by t-test, U-test and multivariate analysis.

RESULTS

The individual clinical cleaning patterns are well reproduced by the robot programmes. Differences in plaque removal are statistically significant for the two brushes, reproduced in clinical and robot data. Multivariate analysis confirms the higher cleaning efficiency for anterior teeth and for the buccal sites.

CONCLUSIONS

The robot tooth brushing simulation programme showed good correlation with clinically standardized tooth brushing.This new robot brushing simulation programme can be used for rapid, reproducible laboratory testing of tooth cleaning.},

@article{Lee.2011,
 abstract = {We present an approach for kinesthetic teaching of motion primitives for a humanoid robot. The proposed teaching method starts with observational learning and applies iterative kinesthetic motion refinement using a forgetting factor. Kinesthetic teaching is supported by introducing the motion refinement tube, which represents an area of allowed motion refinement around the nominal trajectory. On the realtime control level, the kinesthetic teaching is handled by a customized impedance controller, which combines tracking performance with compliant physical interaction and allows to implement soft boundaries for the motion refinement. A novel method for continuous generation of motions from a hidden Markov model (HMM) representation of motion primitives is proposed, which incorporates time information for each state. The proposed methods were implemented and tested using DLR's humanoid upper-body robot Justin.},

 abstract = {Many publications are available on the topic of compliance with infection prevention and control in oral health-care facilities all over the world. The approaches of developing and developed countries show wide variation, but the principles of infection prevention and control are the same globally. This study is a systematic review and global perspective of the available literature on infection prevention and control in oral health-care facilities. Nine focus areas on compliance with infection-control measures were investigated: knowledge of infectious occupational hazards; personal hygiene and care of hands; correct application of personal protective equipment; use of environmental barriers and disposable items; sterilisation (recirculation) of instruments and handpieces; disinfection (surfaces) and housekeeping; management of waste disposal; quality control of dental unit waterlines, biofilms and water; and some special considerations. Various international studies from developed countries have reported highly scientific evidence-based information. In developed countries, the resources for infection prevention and control are freely available, which is not the case in developing countries. The studies in developing countries also indicate serious shortcomings with regard to infection prevention and control knowledge and education in oral health-care facilities. This review highlights the fact that availability of resources will always be a challenge, but more so in developing countries. This presents unique challenges and the opportunity for innovative thinking to promote infection prevention and control.},

@article{OrtizSimon.2011,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Holding a dental tool for many hours of work is reflected in fatigue and manual tremor, which causes bad handling of rotatory instruments and consequently injuries within the buccal cavity. At present there exists no system to help the medical dentist in the support and handling of the dental drill. We propose the use of a mechatronic system to help the odontologist in handling the dental drill.

METHODS

The mechatronic system consists of an articulated arm with force sensors and actuators that are activated electronically. The mechanism was developed so that the handpiece is held simultaneously by the mechatronic arm and the hand of the dentist. Expert dentists and odontology students were asked to execute tasks to assess positioning accuracy and system resolution. Students performed positioning tasks to evaluate adaptation to the system. The subjects drew the contour of a circle with and without the mechatronic assistant to assess positioning accuracy. Similarly, they made cavities on acrylic typodonts to evaluate resolution and accuracy. Adaptation to the system was evaluated by inserting the drill burr into cavities previously made.

RESULTS

The mechatronic system provides support and stability while handling the dental drill. The threshold of force required to move the mechanism prevents involuntary movements affecting the quality of work made on cavities. Positioning accuracy was improved by 53{\%} (p {\textless} 0.017) using the system. Similarly, resolution of drilling was improved by 76{\%} (p {\textless} 0.001).

CONCLUSION

We have developed the first mechatronic system to assist dentists in handling the dental drill. The arm allows the dentist to manipulate the tool with smooth and precise movements during the preparation of dental cavities with the application of force. The mechatronic system minimizes manual tremor due to fatigue and reduces the risk of iatrogenic dental injuries.},

 abstract = {A root canal surgery involves the successive use of several tools one after another. Typically dozens of tools are laid out for possible use, and the process of tool selection is done manually. This is a rather inefficient process and uses up a large area on the mobile cart or cabinet of the dental chair due to the large number of tools. In this article, a novel 'tool vending machine' is introduced which will be capable of solving those problems and at the same time move a step closer to robot-assisted dental surgery. The tool vending machine was designed considering the needs of the dentists and also from the perspective of the entire product life cycle. For these reasons the design process was implemented using a rigorous analysis of effective manufacturing processes and product quality. To show the feasibility of using such a machine in improving work efficiency during operations, a study of the associated motion patterns and the required time increments were demonstrated.},

Against this backdrop, the broad success of Deep Learning (DL) has prompted the development of new image segmentation approaches leveraging DL models. We provide a comprehensive review of this recent literature, covering the spectrum of pioneering efforts in semantic and instance segmentation, including convolutional pixel-labeling networks, encoder-decoder architectures, multiscale and pyramid-based approaches, recurrent networks, visual attention models, and generative models in adversarial settings. We investigate the relationships, strengths, and challenges of these DL-based segmentation models, examine the widely used datasets, compare performances, and discuss promising research directions.},

 abstract = {Learning complex physical tasks via trial-and-error is still challenging for high-degree-of-freedom robots. Greatest challenges are devising a suitable objective function that defines the task, and the high sample complexity of learning the task. We propose a novel active learning framework, consisting of decoupled task model and exploration components, which does not require an objective function. The task model is specific to a task and maps the parameter space, defining a trial, to the trial outcome space. The exploration component enables efficient search in the trial-parameter space to generate the subsequent most informative trials, by simultaneously exploiting all the information gained from previous trials and reducing the task model's overall uncertainty. We analyse the performance of our framework in a simulation environment and further validate it on a challenging bimanual-robot puck-passing task. Results show that the robot successfully acquires the necessary skills after only 100 trials without any prior information about the task or target positions. Decoupling the framework's components also enables efficient skill transfer to new environments which is validated experimentally.},

@article{Ijspeert.2013,
 abstract = {Nonlinear dynamical systems have been used in many disciplines to model complex behaviors, including biological motor control, robotics, perception, economics, traffic prediction, and neuroscience. While often the unexpected emergent behavior of nonlinear systems is the focus of investigations, it is of equal importance to create goal-directed behavior (e.g., stable locomotion from a system of coupled oscillators under perceptual guidance). Modeling goal-directed behavior with nonlinear systems is, however, rather difficult due to the parameter sensitivity of these systems, their complex phase transitions in response to subtle parameter changes, and the difficulty of analyzing and predicting their long-term behavior; intuition and time-consuming parameter tuning play a major role. This letter presents and reviews dynamical movement primitives, a line of research for modeling attractor behaviors of autonomous nonlinear dynamical systems with the help of statistical learning techniques. The essence of our approach is to start with a simple dynamical system, such as a set of linear differential equations, and transform those into a weakly nonlinear system with prescribed attractor dynamics by means of a learnable autonomous forcing term. Both point attractors and limit cycle attractors of almost arbitrary complexity can be generated. We explain the design principle of our approach and evaluate its properties in several example applications in motor control and robotics.},

@article{Jiang.2013,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

The traditional, manual method of reproducing the dental arch form is prone to numerous random errors caused by human factors. The purpose of this study was to investigate the automatic acquisition of the dental arch and implement the motion planning and synchronized control of the dental arch generator of the multi-manipulator tooth-arrangement robot for use in full denture manufacture.

METHODS

First, the mathematical model of the dental arch generator was derived. Then the kinematics and control point position of the dental arch generator of the tooth arrangement robot were calculated and motion planning of each control point was analysed. A hardware control scheme is presented, based on the industrial personal computer and control card PC6401. In order to gain single-axis, precise control of the dental arch generator, we studied the control pulse realization of high-resolution timing. Real-time, closed-loop, synchronous control was applied to the dental arch generator. Experimental control of the dental arch generator and preliminary tooth arrangement were gained by using the multi-manipulator tooth-arrangement robotic system.

RESULTS

The dental arch generator can automatically generate a dental arch to fit a patient according to the patient's arch parameters. Repeated positioning accuracy is 0.12 mm for the slipways that drive the dental arch generator. The maximum value of single-point error is 1.83 mm, while the arc-width direction (x axis) is -33.29 mm.

CONCLUSION

A novel system that generates the dental arch has been developed. The traditional method of manually determining the dental arch may soon be replaced by a robot to assist in generating a more individual dental arch. The system can be used to fabricate full dentures and bend orthodontic wires.},

@article{Pan.2010,
 abstract = {A major assumption in many machine learning and data mining algorithms is that the training and future data must be in the same feature space and have the same distribution. However, in many real-world applications, this assumption may not hold. For example, we sometimes have a classification task in one domain of interest, but we only have sufficient training data in another domain of interest, where the latter data may be in a different feature space or follow a different data distribution. In such cases, knowledge transfer, if done successfully, would greatly improve the performance of learning by avoiding much expensive data-labeling efforts. In recent years, transfer learning has emerged as a new learning framework to address this problem. This survey focuses on categorizing and reviewing the current progress on transfer learning for classification, regression, and clustering problems. In this survey, we discuss the relationship between transfer learning and other related machine learning techniques such as domain adaptation, multitask learning and sample selection bias, as well as covariate shift. We also explore some potential future issues in transfer learning research.},

 abstract = {A key challenge in intelligent robotics is creating robots that are capable of directly interacting with the world around them to achieve their goals. The last decade has seen substantial growth in research on the problem of robot manipulation, which aims to exploit the increasing availability of affordable robot arms and grippers to create robots capable of directly interacting with the world to achieve their goals. Learning will be central to such autonomous systems, as the real world contains too much variation for a robot to expect to have an accurate model of its environment, the objects in it, or the skills required to manipulate them, in advance. We aim to survey a representative subset of that research which uses machine learning for manipulation. We describe a formalization of the robot manipulation learning problem that synthesizes existing research into a single coherent framework and highlight the many remaining research opportunities and challenges.},

@article{Kasahara.2012,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Drilling is used in the medical field, especially in oral surgery and orthopaedics. In recent years, oral surgery involving dental implants has become more common. However, the risky drilling process causes serious accidents. To prevent these accidents, supporting systems such as robotic drilling systems are required.

METHODS

A telerobotic-assisted drilling system is proposed. An acceleration-based four-channel bilateral control system is implemented in linear actuators in a master-slave system for drill feeding. A reaction force observer is used instead of a force sensor for measuring cutting force. Cutting force transmits from a cutting material to a surgeon, who may feel a static cutting resistance force and vigorous cutting vibrations, via the master-slave system. Moreover, position scaling and force scaling are achieved. Scaling functions are used to achieve precise drilling and hazard detection via force sensation.

RESULTS

Cutting accuracy and reproducibility of the cutting force were evaluated by angular velocity/position error and frequency analysis of the cutting force, respectively, and errors were {\textgreater} 2.0 rpm and {\textgreater} 0.2 mm, respectively. Spectrum peaks of the cutting vibration were at the theoretical vibration frequencies of 30, 60 and 90 Hz.

CONCLUSIONS

The proposed telerobotic-assisted drilling system achieved precise manipulation of the drill feed and vivid feedback from the cutting force.},

@article{Pankhurst.2007,
 abstract = {OBJECTIVES

To review the evidence that the dental unit waterlines are a source of occupational and healthcare acquired infection in the dental surgery.

DATA

Transmission of infection from contaminated dental unit waterlines (DUWL) is by aerosol droplet inhalation or rarely imbibing or wound contamination in susceptible individuals. Most of the organisms isolated from DUWL are of low pathogenicity. However, data from a small number of studies described infection or colonisation in susceptible hosts with Legionella spp., Pseudomonas spp. and environmental mycobacteria isolated from DUWL. The reported prevalence of legionellae in DUWL varies widely from 0 to 68{\%}. The risk from prolonged occupational exposure to legionellae has been evaluated. Earlier studies measuring surrogate evidence of exposure to legionellae in dental personnel found a significant increase in legionella antibody levels but in recent multicentre studies undertaken in primary dental care legionellae were isolated at very low rate and the corresponding serological titres were not above background levels. Whereas, a case of fatal Legionellosis in a dental surgeon concluded that the DUWL was the likely source of the infection. The dominant species isolated from dental unit waterlines (DUWL) are Gram-negative bacteria, which are a potent source of cell wall endotoxin. A consequence of indoor endotoxin exposure is the triggering or exacerbation of asthma. Data from a single large practice-based cross-sectional study reported a temporal association between occupational exposure to contaminated DUWL with aerobic counts of {\textgreater}200cfu/mL at 37 degrees C and development of asthma in the sub-group of dentists in whom asthma arose following the commencement of dental training.

SOURCES

Medline 1966 to February 2007 was used to identify studies for this paper.

STUDY SELECTION

Design criteria included randomised control trials, cohort, and observational studies in English.

CONCLUSIONS

Although the number of published cases of infection or respiratory symptoms resulting from exposure to water from contaminated DUWL is limited, there is a medico-legal requirement to comply with potable water standards and to conform to public perceptions on water safety.},

@book{Thompson.2020,
 abstract = {Deep learning's recent history has been one of achievement: from triumphing over humans in the game of Go to world-leading performance in image recognition, voice recognition, translation, and other tasks. But this progress has come with a voracious appetite for computing power. This article reports on the computational demands of Deep Learning applications in five prominent application areas and shows that progress in all five is strongly reliant on increases in computing power. Extrapolating forward this reliance reveals that progress along current lines is rapidly becoming economically, technically, and environmentally unsustainable. Thus, continued progress in these applications will require dramatically more computationally-efficient methods, which will either have to come from changes to deep learning or from moving to other machine learning methods.},

 abstract = {Dental implantation is now recognized as a standard of care for replacing missing teeth. Pre-operative planning with patient-specific images provides the basis for precise surgery, but such accuracy is hampered to some degree because of the manual drilling procedures performed by the surgeon. In this paper, a robotic system for automated site preparation for dental implants is presented in order to provide high accuracy drilling. The results of some experiments are given to validate the system. Additionally, results are shown for jaw surgery that utilize natural-root-formed implants which can contain multiple roots. This more complex type of implant is impossible to drill manually but can provide better long-term stability and success. With this robotic system, controlled and accurate drilling was achieved, which made more advanced implant designs possible.},

@article{Zhang.2010,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

The traditional way of acquiring the dental arch curve form is based on manual operation, which will randomly bring numerous errors caused by human factors. The purpose of this paper is to automatically acquire the dental arch curve and implement the coordinated control of the dental arch generator of the multi-manipulator tooth-arrangement robot, which can be used in full denture manufacturing.

METHODS

Based on the arc length constant theory, kinematics on dental arch generator is analyzed. The control pulse realization methods of high-resolution timing and CPU time-stamp timing are studied, and testing and comparative analysis of the control precision and stability of the two methods is carried out. Control experimentation of the dental arch generator and preliminary tooth-arrangement experimentation are performed using the multi-manipulator tooth-arrangement robot system.

RESULTS

The dental arch generator can automatically generate a dental arch curve that fits a patient according to the patient's jaw arch parameters. Repeated positioning accuracy is 0.12 mm for the slipways which drive the dental arch generator. The maximum value of single point error is 1.64 mm when the arc width direction (x-axis) is 37.25 mm. The experimental results indicate that the method of control pulse realized by high-resolution timing to achieve high precision coordinated motion control of dental arch generator of tooth-arrangement robot is feasible. The error analysis results indicate that the control strategy and technical route can fulfill the requirements for motion speed and location precision.

CONCLUSION

A novel system to generate the tooth arch curve has been developed. The traditional method of manually determining the dental arch may soon become obsolete in favour of the use of a robot to assist in generating a more standard tooth arch curve. The system can be used to manufacture a full denture. It will lay an important theoretical foundation for quantitative research of oral restoration, and also provide a way to standardize the manufacturing process of full denture.},

 abstract = {In order to advance action generation and creation in robots beyond  simple learned schemas we need  computational tools that allow us to automatically interpret and represent human actions. This paper presents a system that learns manipulation action plans by processing unconstrained videos from the World Wide Web. Its goal is to robustly generate the  sequence of atomic actions of seen longer actions in video in order to acquire knowledge for robots. The lower level of the system consists of two convolutional neural network (CNN) based recognition modules, one for classifying the hand grasp type and the other for object recognition. The higher level is a probabilistic manipulation action grammar based parsing module that aims at generating visual sentences for robot manipulation. Experiments conducted on a publicly available unconstrained video dataset show that the system is able to learn manipulation actions by ``watching'' unconstrained videos with high accuracy.},

@article{Widmann.2009,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Navigated oral implant surgery requires knowledge and skills in computed tomography (CT) imaging, three-dimensional (3D) planning, and use of surgical navigation systems. To improve teaching and training, a laboratory training and evaluation technique has been developed.

METHODS

The technique uses a surgical navigation system, a dental dummy and anonymous data of previously treated patients, including duplicated dental stone casts, individualized registration mouthpieces and CT scans. Training consists of definition of the prosthetic goal, 3D planning and navigated model surgery. For evaluation, a post-surgical CT of the drilled dental stone casts is fused with the original planning CT.

RESULTS

Each step of navigated implant surgery can be simulated and trained. Post-surgical evaluation includes Euclidean distance, normal distance, angular deviations and damage to critical anatomical structures, such as nerves and sinuses.

CONCLUSIONS

The presented technique allows for successful laboratory training and evaluation of computer-aided oral implant surgery.},

@book{Pormann.2018,
 abstract = {{\textquotedbl}Hippocrates is a towering figure in Greek medicine. Dubbed the 'father of medicine', he has inspired generations of physicians over millennia in both the East and West. Despite this, little is known about him, and scholars have long debated his relationship to the works attributed to him in the so-called 'Hippocratic Corpus', although it is undisputed that many of the works within it represent milestones in the development of Western medicine. In this Cambridge Companion, an international team of authors introduces major themes in Hippocratic studies, ranging from textual criticism and the 'Hippocratic Question' to problems such as aetiology, physiology and nosology. Emphasis is given to the afterlife of Hippocrates from Late Antiquity to the Modern period. Hippocrates had as much relevance in the fifth-century BC Greek world as in the medieval Islamic world, and he remains with us today in both medical and non-medical contexts{\textquotedbl}--},

 abstract = {This volume presents a collection of papers presented at the 14th International Symposium of Robotic Research (ISRR). ISRR is the biennial meeting of the International Foundation of Robotic Research (IFRR) and its 14th edition took place in Lucerne, Switzerland, from August 31st to September 3rd, 2009. As for the previous symposia, ISRR 2009 followed up on the successful concept of a mixture of invited contributions and open submissions. Half of the 48 presentations were therefore invited contributions from outstanding researchers selected by the IFRR officers, and half were chosen among the 66 submissions after peer review. This selection process resulted in a truly excellent technical program which, we believe, featured some of the very best of robotic research. Out of the 48 presentations, the 42 papers which were finally submitted for publication are organized in 8 sections that encompass the major research orientations in robotics: Navigation, Control {\&} Planning, Human-Robot Interaction, Manipulation and Humanoids, Learning, Mapping, Multi-Robot Systems, and Micro-Robotics. They represent an excellent snapshot of cutting-edge research in robotics and outline future directions.},

The human mandible, guided by a range of passive structures moves with up to six degrees of freedom (DOF). Currently available wear simulators lack the ability to perform these complex chewing movements. In addition simulators are unable to replicate the normal range of chewing forces as they have no control system able to mimic the natural muscle function controlled by the human central nervous system. Such discrepancies between true in vivo and simulated in vitro movements will influence the outcome and reliability of wear studies using such approaches. This paper summarizes the development of a new dynamic jaw simulator based on the kinematics of the human jaw.},

@article{Raabe.2012,
 abstract = {This paper presents a new in vitro wear simulator based on spatial parallel kinematics and a biologically inspired implicit force/position hybrid controller to replicate chewing movements and dental wear formations on dental components, such as crowns, bridges or a full set of teeth. The human mandible, guided by passive structures such as posterior teeth and the two temporomandibular joints, moves with up to 6 degrees of freedom (DOF) in Cartesian space. The currently available wear simulators lack the ability to perform these chewing movements. In many cases, their lack of sufficient DOF enables them only to replicate the sliding motion of a single occlusal contact point by neglecting rotational movements and the motion along one Cartesian axis. The motion and forces of more than one occlusal contact points cannot accurately be replicated by these instruments. Furthermore, the majority of wear simulators are unable to control simultaneously the main wear-affecting parameters, considering abrasive mechanical wear, which are the occlusal sliding motion and bite forces in the constraint contact phase of the human chewing cycle. It has been shown that such discrepancies between the true in vivo and the simulated in vitro condition influence the outcome and the quality of wear studies. This can be improved by implementing biological features of the human masticatory system such as tooth compliance realized through the passive action of the periodontal ligament and active bite force control realized though the central nervous system using feedback from periodontal preceptors. The simulator described in this paper can be used for single- and multi-occlusal contact testing due to its kinematics and ability to exactly replicate human translational and rotational mandibular movements with up to 6 DOF without neglecting movements along or around the three Cartesian axes. Recorded human mandibular motion and occlusal force data are the reference inputs of the simulator. Experimental studies of wear using this simulator demonstrate that integrating the biological feature of combined force/position hybrid control in dental material testing improves the linearity and reduces the variability of results. In addition, it has been shown that present biaxially operated dental wear simulators are likely to provide misleading results in comparative in vitro/in vivo one-contact studies due to neglecting the occlusal sliding motion in one plane which could introduce an error of up to 49{\%} since occlusal sliding motion D and volumetric wear loss V(loss) are proportional.},

@article{Rautaray.2015,
 abstract = {As computers become more pervasive in society, facilitating natural human--computer interaction (HCI) will have a positive impact on their use. Hence, there has been growing interest in the development of new approaches and technologies for bridging the human--computer barrier. The ultimate aim is to bring HCI to a regime where interactions with computers will be as natural as an interaction between humans, and to this end, incorporating gestures in HCI is an important research area. Gestures have long been considered as an interaction technique that can potentially deliver more natural, creative and intuitive methods for communicating with our computers. This paper provides an analysis of comparative surveys done in this area. The use of hand gestures as a natural interface serves as a motivating force for research in gesture taxonomies, its representations and recognition techniques, software platforms and frameworks which is discussed briefly in this paper. It focuses on the three main phases of hand gesture recognition i.e. detection, tracking and recognition. Different application which employs hand gestures for efficient interaction has been discussed under core and advanced application domains. This paper also provides an analysis of existing literature related to gesture recognition systems for human computer interaction by categorizing it under different key parameters. It further discusses the advances that are needed to further improvise the present hand gesture recognition systems for future perspective that can be widely used for efficient human computer interaction. The main goal of this survey is to provide researchers in the field of gesture based HCI with a summary of progress achieved to date and to help identify areas where further research is needed.},

However, off-the-shelf machine learning appears not to be adequate for robot skill learning, as it neither scales to anthropomorphic robotics nor do fulfills the crucial real-time requirements. As an alternative, we propose to divide the generic skill learning problem into parts that can be well-understood from a robotics point of view. In this context, we have developed machine learning methods applicable to robot skill learning. This paper discusses recent progress ranging from simple skill learning problems to a game of robot table tennis.},

 abstract = {OBJECTIVE

The current status of human-robot interaction (HRI) is reviewed, and key current research challenges for the human factors community are described.

BACKGROUND

Robots have evolved from continuous human-controlled master-slave servomechanisms for handling nuclear waste to a broad range of robots incorporating artificial intelligence for many applications and under human supervisory control.

METHODS

This mini-review describes HRI developments in four application areas and what are the challenges for human factors research.

RESULTS

In addition to a plethora of research papers, evidence of success is manifest in live demonstrations of robot capability under various forms of human control.

CONCLUSIONS

HRI is a rapidly evolving field. Specialized robots under human teleoperation have proven successful in hazardous environments and medical application, as have specialized telerobots under human supervisory control for space and repetitive industrial tasks. Research in areas of self-driving cars, intimate collaboration with humans in manipulation tasks, human control of humanoid robots for hazardous environments, and social interaction with robots is at initial stages. The efficacy of humanoid general-purpose robots has yet to be proven.

APPLICATIONS

HRI is now applied in almost all robot tasks, including manufacturing, space, aviation, undersea, surgery, rehabilitation, agriculture, education, package fetch and delivery, policing, and military operations.},

@article{Schiroli.2016,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

This work evaluated the accuracy and safety of a protocol for minimally-invasive flapless zygomatic implant placement that uses computer-guided stereolithographic mucosa-supported surgical templates.

METHODS

A total of six zygomatic implants were placed in three formalin-fixed human cadaver heads, with edentulous and severely atrophic posterior maxillae. CT scans of each cadaver head were performed after zygomatic implant placement, to evaluate the lateral error (LE) at implant tip and base, and the angular error (AE) of the implant body.

RESULTS

Excluding the implant placed outside the drilling channel, the LE at the implant base was less than 1 mm in all cases. The average LE at the tip was 3.86 mm, and the AE was less than 6° in all cases, with an average of 4.5°.

CONCLUSION

Computer-guided minimally-invasive flapless zygomatic implant surgery remains challenging. Careful planning and perfect stability of the surgical guide are essential.},

 abstract = {This paper discusses a comprehensive framework for modular motor control based on a recently developed theory of dynamic movement primitives (DMP). DMPs are a formulation of movement primitives with autonomous nonlinear differential equations, whose time evolution creates smooth kinematic control policies. Model-based control theory is used to convert the outputs of these policies into motor commands. By means of coupling terms, on-line modifications can be incorporated into the time evolution of the differential equations, thus providing a rather flexible and reactive framework for motor planning and execution. The linear parameterization of DMPs lends itself naturally to supervised learning from demonstration. Moreover, the temporal, scale, and translation invariance of the differential equations with respect to these parameters provides a useful means for movement recognition. A novel reinforcement learning technique based on natural stochastic policy gradients allows a general approach of improving DMPs by trial and error learning with respect to almost arbitrary optimization criteria. We demonstrate the different ingredients of the DMP approach in various examples, involving skill learning from demonstration on the humanoid robot DB, and learning biped walking from demonstration in simulation, including self-improvement of the movement patterns towards energy efficiency through resonance tuning.},

In the present study, a new electronic model ROBOTUTOR was designed to compare the efficacy of different modes of dental health education for demonstration of the Bass toothbrushing technique and also to evaluate its efficacy with different modes of dental health education in patient understanding.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Total 150 subjects were randomized into two groups, Group 1 (Questionnaire) and Group II (Investigators). Subjects with history of gingivitis and only mild periodontitis were included. Demonstration of Bass technique was given to each subject with the help of three different modes, i.e., ROBOTUTOR, clinician, and audio-video aids.

RESULTS

The result was evaluated in terms of effectiveness, ease of understanding, attraction, and recollection. In the present study, the best mode of education is clinician demonstration and the least effective one is the audio-video mode. In contrast, the ROBOTUTOR model was found to be more attractive than the other two.

CONCLUSION

Although demonstration by clinician is the best, it is time consuming and not feasible for community purpose. ROBOTUTOR would thus save clinician's chair side time and help in effective demonstration of the brushing technique.},

The research community's recent surge of interest in this area has been devoted to the implementation of various methodologies to achieve intuitive and seamless human--robot-environment interactions by incorporating the collaborative partners' superior capabilities, e.g. human's cognitive and robot's physical power generation capacity. In fact, the main purpose of this paper is to review the state-of-the-art on intermediate human--robot interfaces (bi-directional), robot control modalities, system stability, benchmarking and relevant use cases, and to extend views on the required future developments in the realm of human--robot collaboration.},

@article{Alqaudi.2016,
 abstract = {This paper presents a novel enhanced human-robot interaction system based on model reference adaptive control. The presented method delivers guaranteed stability and task performance and has two control loops. A robot-specific inner loop, which is a neuroadaptive controller, learns the robot dynamics online and makes the robot respond like a prescribed impedance model. This loop uses no task information, including no prescribed trajectory. A task-specific outer loop takes into account the human operator dynamics and adapts the prescribed robot impedance model so that the combined human-robot system has desirable characteristics for task performance. This design is based on model reference adaptive control, but of a nonstandard form. The net result is a controller with both adaptive impedance characteristics and assistive inputs that augment the human operator to provide improved task performance of the human-robot team. Simulations verify the performance of the proposed controller in a repetitive point-to-point motion task. Actual experimental implementations on a PR2 robot further corroborate the effectiveness of the approach.},

 abstract = {-- The purpose of this paper is to propose a new algorithm based on programming by demonstration and exception strategies to solve assembly tasks such as peg-in-hole. , -- Data describing the demonstrated tasks are obtained by kinesthetic guiding. The demonstrated trajectories are transferred to new robot workspaces using three-dimensional (3D) vision. Noise introduced by vision when transferring the task to a new configuration could cause the execution to fail, but such problems are resolved through exception strategies. , -- This paper demonstrated that the proposed approach combined with exception strategies outperforms traditional approaches for robot-based assembly. Experimental evaluation was carried out on Cranfield Benchmark, which constitutes a standardized assembly task in robotics. This paper also performed statistical evaluation based on experiments carried out on two different robotic platforms. , -- The developed framework can have an important impact for robot assembly processes, which are among the most important applications of industrial robots. Our future plans involve implementation of our framework in a commercially available robot controller. , -- This paper proposes a new approach to the robot assembly based on the Learning by Demonstration (LbD) paradigm. The proposed framework enables to quickly program new assembly tasks without the need for detailed analysis of the geometric and dynamic characteristics of workpieces involved in the assembly task. The algorithm provides an effective disturbance rejection, improved stability and increased overall performance. The proposed exception strategies increase the success rate of the algorithm when the task is transferred to new areas of the workspace, where it is necessary to deal with vision noise and altered dynamic characteristics of the task.},

 abstract = {Dexterous manipulation is one of the primary goals in robotics. Robots with this capability could sort and package objects, chop vegetables, and fold clothes. As robots come to work side by side with humans, they must also become human-aware. Over the past decade, research has made strides toward these goals. Progress has come from advances in visual and haptic perception and in mechanics in the form of soft actuators that offer a natural compliance. Most notably, immense progress in machine learning has been leveraged to encapsulate models of uncertainty and to support improvements in adaptive and robust control. Open questions remain in terms of how to enable robots to deal with the most unpredictable agent of all, the human.},

The development of Evolution Strategies from the first mutation--selection scheme to the refined (¯,)--ES including the general concept of self--adaptation of the strategy parameters for the mutation variances as well as their covariances are described. 1 Introduction  The idea to use principles of organic evolution processes as rules for optimum seeking procedures emerged independently on both sides of the Atlantic ocean more than two decades ago. Both approaches rely upon imitating the collective learning paradigm of natural populations, based upon Darwin's observations and the modern synthetic theory of evolution. In the USA Holland introduced Genetic Algorithms  in the 60ies, embedded into the general framework of adaptation [Hol75]. He also mentioned the applicability to parameter optimization which was fir...},

 abstract = {Digitization has become part and parcel of the contemporary prosthodontics with the probability of most of the procedures being based on the digital techniques in near future. Let us think of X-rays or photographs, making impressions, recording jaw movements or fabricating prosthesis, educating and training new dentists or patient motivation for practice build up, all has become digital. CAD-CAM has revolutionized not just the ceramic technology but has also been used for the CAD-CAM implant surgeries, maxillofacial prosthesis and diagnostic splints. Today a practicing dentist needs to be abreast with the latest but with the technology changing so fast, this poses a great challenge. There is endless scope of digitisation and technology in prosthodontics- let it be in the clinical and lab procedures like use of CAD-CAM technology, stereolithography, rapid prototyping, use of virtual articulators and digital face bows, digital radiographs, or in the field of training, education and research by the use of virtual patient programs, dental softwares, optoelectronic recording of jaw motion, digital instron machine, retention testing device, audiovisual aids,$\ldots$ the list will remain endless. The article reviews those various aspects of prosthodontics where digitization has modified the conventional procedures. For discussion they have been considered under the educational aspect, diagnostics, treatment procedures, prosthesis fabrication and lastly the research and futuristic development. The day is not far when remote sensing robotic devices would be performing the restorations under the command and surveillance of the master-the dentist without his immediate presence.},

@article{Burdet.2001,
 abstract = {To manipulate objects or to use tools we must compensate for any forces arising from interaction with the physical environment. Recent studies indicate that this compensation is achieved by learning an internal model of the dynamics, that is, a neural representation of the relation between motor command and movement. In these studies interaction with the physical environment was stable, but many common tasks are intrinsically unstable. For example, keeping a screwdriver in the slot of a screw is unstable because excessive force parallel to the slot can cause the screwdriver to slip and because misdirected force can cause loss of contact between the screwdriver and the screw. Stability may be dependent on the control of mechanical impedance in the human arm because mechanical impedance can generate forces which resist destabilizing motion. Here we examined arm movements in an unstable dynamic environment created by a robotic interface. Our results show that humans learn to stabilize unstable dynamics using the skillful and energy-efficient strategy of selective control of impedance geometry.},

 abstract = {Point cloud learning has lately attracted increasing attention due to its wide applications in many areas, such as computer vision, autonomous driving, and robotics. As a dominating technique in AI, deep learning has been successfully used to solve various 2D vision problems. However, deep learning on point clouds is still in its infancy due to the unique challenges faced by the processing of point clouds with deep neural networks. Recently, deep learning on point clouds has become even thriving, with numerous methods being proposed to address different problems in this area. To stimulate future research, this paper presents a comprehensive review of recent progress in deep learning methods for point clouds. It covers three major tasks, including 3D shape classification, 3D object detection and tracking, and 3D point cloud segmentation. It also presents comparative results on several publicly available datasets, together with insightful observations and inspiring future research directions.},

For this we need to provide both practical and theoretical experience in robotics to young people and give them access to state-of-the art, high performance yet affordable industrial robotic technology. Specifically, our approach systematically connects different existing school types, universities as well as companies. It comprises specialized lectures at the university, certified workshops and Robothons which are derived from the hackathon concept, and modified to the demand of roboticists.},

 abstract = {OBJECTIVES

This paper provides an overview of existing applications and concepts of robotic systems and artificial intelligence in dentistry. This review aims to provide the community with novel inputs and argues for an increased utilization of these recent technological developments, referred to as Dentronics, in order to advance dentistry.

METHODS

First, background on developments in robotics, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are reviewed that may enable novel assistive applications in dentistry (Sec A). Second, a systematic technology review that evaluates existing state-of-the-art applications in AI, ML and robotics in the context of dentistry is presented (Sec B).

RESULTS

A systematic literature research in pubmed yielded in a total of 558 results. 41 studies related to ML, 53 studies related to AI and 49 original research papers on robotics application in dentistry were included. ML and AI have been applied in dental research to analyze large amounts of data to eventually support dental decision making, diagnosis, prognosis and treatment planning with the help of data-driven analysis algorithms based on machine learning. So far, only few robotic applications have made it to reality, mostly restricted to pilot use cases.

SIGNIFICANCE

The authors believe that dentistry can greatly benefit from the current rise of digital human-centered automation and be transformed towards a new robotic, ML and AI-enabled era. In the future, Dentronics will enhance reliability, reproducibility, accuracy and efficiency in dentistry through the democratized use of modern dental technologies, such as medical robot systems and specialized artificial intelligence. Dentronics will increase our understanding of disease pathogenesis, improve risk-assessment-strategies, diagnosis, disease prediction and finally lead to better treatment outcomes.},

@article{Howard.2019,
 abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is a broad transdisciplinary field with roots in logic, statistics, cognitive psychology, decision theory, neuroscience, linguistics, cybernetics, and computer engineering. The modern field of AI began at a small summer workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956. Since then, AI applications made possible by machine learning (ML), an AI subdiscipline, include Internet searches, e-commerce sites, goods and services recommender systems, image and speech recognition, sensor technologies, robotic devices, and cognitive decision support systems (DSSs). As more applications are integrated into everyday life, AI is predicted to have a globally transformative influence on economic and social structures similar to the effect that other general-purpose technologies, such as steam engines, railroads, electricity, electronics, and the Internet, have had. Novel AI applications in the workplace of the future raise important issues for occupational safety and health. This commentary reviews the origins of AI, use of ML methods, and emerging AI applications embedded in physical objects like sensor technologies, robotic devices, or operationalized in intelligent DSSs. Selected implications on the future of work arising from the use of AI applications, including job displacement from automation and management of human-machine interactions, are also reviewed. Engaging in strategic foresight about AI workplace applications will shift occupational research and practice from a reactive posture to a proactive one. Understanding the possibilities and challenges of AI for the future of work will help mitigate~the unfavorable effects of AI on worker safety, health, and well-being.},

@inproceedings{Haddadin.2011,
 abstract = {Recently, robots have gained capabilities in both sensing and actuation, which enable operation in the proximity of humans. Even direct physical interaction has become possible without suffering the decrease in speed and payload. The DLR Lightweight Robot III (LWR-III), whose technology is currently being transferred to the robot manufacturer KUKA Roboter GmbH, is such a device capable of realizing various features crucial for direct interaction with humans. Impedance control and collision detection with adequate reaction are key components for enabling ``soft and safe'' robotics. The implementation of a sensor based robotic co-worker that brings robots closer to humans in industrial settings and achieve close cooperation is an important goal in robotics. Despite being a common vision in robotics it has not become reality yet, as there are various open questions still to be answered. In this paper a sound concept and a prototype implementation of a co-worker scenario are developed in order to demonstrate that stateof- the-art technology is now mature enough to reach this aspiring aim. We support our ideas by addressing the industrially relevant bin-picking problem with the LWR-III, which is equipped with a Time-of-Flight camera for object recognition and the DLR 3D-Modeller for generating accurate environment models. The paper describes the sophisticated control schemes of the robot in combination with robust computer vision algorithms, which lead to a reliable solution for the addressed problem. Strategies are devised for safe interaction with the human during task execution, state depending robot behavior, and the appropriate mechanisms, to realize robustness in partially unstructured environments.},

@article{Hangl.2020,
 abstract = {We consider the problem of autonomous acquisition of manipulation skills where problem-solving strategies are initially available only for a narrow range of situations. We propose to extend the range of solvable situations by autonomous play with the object. By applying previously-trained skills and behaviors, the robot learns how to prepare situations for which a successful strategy is already known. The information gathered during autonomous play is additionally used to train an environment model. This model is exploited for active learning and the generation of novel preparatory behaviors compositions. We apply our approach to a wide range of different manipulation tasks, e.g., book grasping, grasping of objects of different sizes by selecting different grasping strategies, placement on shelves, and tower disassembly. We show that the composite behavior generation mechanism enables the robot to solve previously-unsolvable tasks, e.g., tower disassembly. We use success statistics gained during real-world experiments to simulate the convergence behavior of our system. Simulation experiments show that the learning speed can be improved by around 30{\%} by using active learning.},

@article{Hansen.2001,
 abstract = {This paper puts forward two useful methods for self-adaptation of the mutation distribution - the concepts of derandomization and cumulation. Principle shortcomings of the concept of mutative strategy parameter control and two levels of derandomization are reviewed. Basic demands on the self-adaptation of arbitrary (normal) mutation distributions are developed. Applying arbitrary, normal mutation distributions is equivalent to applying a general, linear problem encoding. The underlying objective of mutative strategy parameter control is roughly to favor previously selected mutation steps in the future. If this objective is pursued rigorously, a completely derandomized self-adaptation scheme results, which adapts arbitrary normal mutation distributions. This scheme, called covariance matrix adaptation (CMA), meets the previously stated demands. It can still be considerably improved by cumulation - utilizing an evolution path rather than single search steps. Simulations on various test functions reveal local and global search properties of the evolution strategy with and without covariance matrix adaptation. Their performances are comparable only on perfectly scaled functions. On badly scaled, non-separable functions usually a speed up factor of several orders of magnitude is observed. On moderately mis-scaled functions a speed up factor of three to ten can be expected.},

 abstract = {Computers used as supporting tools for diagnostics, operation planning and therapy are of increasing relevance in surgery. Rapid progress in imaging techniques such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRT) and ultrasound already allows to represent anatomical and physiological conditions with maximal authenticity. In order to simulate complex surgeries we must develop ergonomic and intuitively useable software tools, thus enabling a precise and fast virtual execution of the planned surgical intervention preoperatively. Intraoperative support will consist of passive navigation tools, available already today, supporting the intraoperative orientation and, in the future, robots performing specific steps autonomously. Methods of augmented reality for the interaction of virtual objects and the real surgical scene are also suitable for the visualization of planning data and other medically relevant information in the operation {\textless}I{\textgreater}situs{\textless}/I{\textgreater}. In maxillofacial and craniofacial surgery the techniques mentioned have been applied in all fields from dental implantology up to the correction of craniofacial malformations and the resection of skull base tumors. Many applications are still being developed or are still in the form of a prototype. However, it is already clear that developments in this area will have a considerable effect on a surgeon's routine work.},

 abstract = {Designing gaits and corresponding control policies is a key challenge in robot locomotion. Even with a viable controller parametrization, finding near-optimal parameters can be daunting. Typically, this kind of parameter optimization requires specific expert knowledge and extensive robot experiments. Automatic black-box gait optimization methods greatly reduce the need for human expertise and time-consuming design processes. Many different approaches for automatic gait optimization have been suggested to date. However, no extensive comparison among them has yet been performed. In this article, we thoroughly discuss multiple automatic optimization methods in the context of gait optimization. We extensively evaluate Bayesian optimization, a model-based approach to black-box optimization under uncertainty, on both simulated problems and real robots. This evaluation demonstrates that Bayesian optimization is particularly suited for robotic applications, where it is crucial to find a good set of gait parameters in a small number of experiments.},

@article{Chiarelli.2012,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Using oral implantology software and transferring the preoperative planning into a stereolithographic model, prosthodontists can produce the related surgical guide. This procedure has some disadvantages: bone-supported stent invasiveness, lack of references due to scattering and non-negligible stereolithography cost. An alternative solution is presented that provides an ideal surgical stent (not invasive, precise, and cheap) as a result. This work focuses on the third phase of a fully 3D approach to oral implant planning, that starts by CT scanning a patient who wears a markers-equipped radiological stent, continues exploiting built-on-purpose preoperative planning software, and finishes producing the ideal surgical template.

METHODS

A 5-axes bur-equipped robot has been designed able to reproduce the milling vectors planned by the software. Software-robot interfacing has been achieved properly matching the stent reference frame and the software and robot coordinate systems. Invasiveness has been avoided achieving the surgical stent from the mucosa-supported radiological mask wax-up. Scattering is ignored because of the surgical stent independency from the bone structure radiography. Production cost has been strongly reduced by avoiding the stereolithographic model. Finally, software-robot interfacing precision has been validated comparing digitally a multi-marker base and its planning transfer.

RESULTS

Average position and orientation errors (respectively 0.283 mm $\pm$ 0.073 mm and 1.798° $\pm$ 0.496°) were significantly better than those achieved using methods based on stereolithography (respectively, 1.45 mm $\pm$ 1.42 mm and 7.25° $\pm$ 2.67°, with a general best maximum translation discrepancy of about 1.1 mm).

CONCLUSIONS

This paper describes the last step of a fully 3D approach in which implant planning can be done in a 3D environment, and the correct position, orientation and depth of the planned implants are easily computed and transferred to the surgical phase.},

 abstract = {In this study, an image-guided system for oral implant placement was assessed. A specially designed mechanical tool has been elaborated to transfer the preoperative implant axis planned on 3-dimensional imagery into a surgical template by a numerically controlled drilling machine. The main drawback of image-guiding systems is the use of preoperative computed tomography, which is expensive and delivers high radiation doses. Therefore, in this study the image-guiding system was coupled with a cone-beam tomograph that significantly decreased both cost and radiation doses. Three edentulous models were used. To determine the accuracy of the system, the ability of a 1.8-mm diameter drill to enter a 2.0-mm diameter, 10-mm-long titanium tube inserted on the model with no contact was verified. Because the drill entered the tubes with no contact and went beyond the end of the tube, the transfer error was less than 0.2 mm for translation and less than 1.1 degrees for rotation. The method presented here is low cost and high precision compared to other technological solutions such as tracking. Further assessment in the surgical field should lead to daily use of this system for flapless surgery, to prepare a prosthesis prior to surgery for immediate loading, to reduce risk of injuring critical anatomical structures and to eliminate manual placement error.},

@article{Dietrich.2016,
 abstract = {Humanoid service robots in domestic environments have to interact with humans and their surroundings in a safe and reliable way. One way to manage that is to equip the robotic systems with force-torque sensors to realize a physically compliant whole-body behavior via impedance control. To provide mobility, such robots often have wheeled platforms. The main advantage is that no balancing effort has to be made compared to legged humanoids. However, the nonholonomy of most wheeled systems prohibits the direct implementation of impedance control due to kinematic rolling constraints that must be taken into account in modeling and control. In this paper we design a whole-body impedance controller for such a robot, which employs an admittance interface to the kinematically controlled mobile platform. The upper body impedance control law, the platform admittance interface, and the compensation of dynamic couplings between both subsystems yield a passive closed loop. The convergence of the state to an invariant set is shown. To prove asymptotic stability in the case of redundancy, priority-based approaches can be employed. In principle, the presented approach is the extension of the well-known and established impedance controller to mobile robots. Experimental validations are performed on the humanoid robot Rollin' Justin. The method is suitable for compliant manipulation tasks with low-dimensional planning in the task space.},
