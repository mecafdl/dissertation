  abstract  = {In this chapter, several different robotic applications are examined. Given that a myriad of industrial applications require robots to perform repetitious tasks (e.g., assembly, manipulation, inspection), the first robotic control application examined in this chapter the development of learning control methods that exploit the periodic nature of the robot dynamics to improve link position tracking performance. Some of the advantages of a learning-based controller over some other approaches include the ability to compensate for disturbances without high-frequency or high-gain feedback terms and the ability to compensate for time-varying disturbances that can include time-varying parametric effects. In the first section of this chapter, we illustrate how a saturated learning-based estimate can be used to achieve asymptotic tracking in the presence of periodic nonlinear disturbances. Since the learning-based controller estimate is generated from a Lyapunov-based stability analysis, we also illustrate how additional control terms can be integrated to compensate for nonperiodic components of the unknown dynamics Specifically, a hybrid adaptive/learning controller is designed for the robot manipulator dynamics. Experimental results are provided to illustrate that the link position tracking performance of a robot manipulator improves with each repetitive motion due to the mitigating action of the learning estimate.},

  abstract  = {With the increased application of model-based whole-
	body control in legged robots, there has been a resurgence of re-
	search interest into methods for accurate system identification. An
	important class of methods focuses on the inertial parameters of
	rigid-body systems. These parameters consist of the mass, first
	mass moment (related to center of mass location), and rotational
	inertia matrix of each link. The main contribution of this letter is
	to formulate physical-consistency constraints on these parameters
	as Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs). The use of these constraints
	in identification can accelerate convergence and increase robust-
	ness to noisy data. It is critically observed that the proposed LMIs
	are expressed in terms of the covariance of the mass distribution,
	rather than its rotational moments of inertia. With this perspective,
	connections to the classical problem of moments in mathematics
	are shown to yield new bounding-volume constraints on the mass
	distribution of each link. While previous work ensured physical
	plausibility or used convex optimization in identification, the LMIs
	here uniquely enable both advantages. Constraints are applied to
	identification of a leg for the MIT Cheetah 3 robot. Detailed proper-
	ties of transmission components are identified alongside link iner-
	tias, with parameter optimization carried out to global optimality
	through semidefinite programming.},

	abstract    = {Accurate models of the world are built upon notions of its underlying symmetries. In physics, these symmetries correspond to conservation laws, such as for energy and momentum. Yet even though neural network models see increasing use in the physical sciences, they struggle to learn these symmetries. In this paper, we propose Lagrangian Neural Networks (LNNs), which can parameterize arbitrary Lagrangians using neural networks. In contrast to models that learn Hamiltonians, LNNs do not require canonical coordinates, and thus perform well in situations where canonical momenta are unknown or difficult to compute. Unlike previous approaches, our method does not restrict the functional form of learned energies and will produce energy-conserving models for a variety of tasks. We test our approach on a double pendulum and a relativistic particle, demonstrating energy conservation where a baseline approach incurs dissipation and modeling relativity without canonical coordinates where a Hamiltonian approach fails. Finally, we show how this model can be applied to graphs and continuous systems using a Lagrangian Graph Network, and demonstrate it on the 1D wave equation.},

  abstract        = {This work presents methods for the determination of a humanoid robot's joint velocities and accelerations directly from link-mounted Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) each containing a three-axis gyroscope and a three-axis accelerometer. No information about the global pose of the floating base or its links is required and precise knowledge of the link IMU poses is not necessary due to presented calibration routines. Additionally, a filter is introduced to fuse gyroscope angular velocities with joint position measurements and compensate the computed joint velocities for time-varying gyroscope biases. The resulting joint velocities are subject to less noise and delay than filtered velocities computed from numerical differentiation of joint potentiometer signals, leading to superior performance in joint feedback control as demonstrated in experiments performed on a SARCOS hydraulic humanoid.},

  abstract  = {The first “object” that newborn children play with is their own body. This activity allows them to autonomously form a sensorimotor map of their own body and a repertoire of actions supporting future cognitive and motor development. Here we propose the theoretical hypothesis, operationalized as a computational model, that this acquisition of body knowledge is not guided by random motor-babbling, but rather by autonomously generated goals formed on the basis of intrinsic motivations. Motor exploration leads the agent to discover and form representations of the possible sensory events it can cause with its own actions. When the agent realizes the possibility of improving the competence to re-activate those representations, it is intrinsically motivated to select and pursue them as goals. The model is based on four components: (1) a self-organizing neural network, modulated by competence-based intrinsic motivations, that acquires abstract representations of experienced sensory (touch) changes; (2) a selector that selects the goal to pursue, and the motor resources to train to pursue it, on the basis of competence improvement; (3) an echo-state neural network that controls and learns, through goal-accomplishment and competence, the agent's motor skills; (4) a predictor of the accomplishment of the selected goals generating the competence-based intrinsic motivation signals. The model is tested as the controller of a simulated simple planar robot composed of a torso and two kinematic 3-DoF 2D arms. The robot explores its body covered by touch sensors by moving its arms. The results, which might be used to guide future empirical experiments, show how the system converges to goals and motor skills allowing it to touch the different parts of own body and how the morphology of the body affects the formed goals. The convergence is strongly dependent on competence-based intrinsic motivations affecting not only skill learning and the selection of formed goals, but also the formation of the goal representations themselves.},

  abstract = {Intrinsic motivation, centrally involved in spontaneous exploration and curiosity, is a crucial concept in developmental psychology. It has been argued to be a crucial mechanism for open-ended cognitive development in humans, and as such has gathered a growing interest from developmental roboticists in the recent years. The goal of this paper is threefold. First, it provides a synthesis of the different approaches of intrinsic motivation in psychology. Second, by interpreting these approaches in a computational reinforcement learning framework, we argue that they are not operational and even sometimes inconsistent. Third, we set the ground for a systematic operational study of intrinsic motivation by presenting a formal typology of possible computational approaches. This typology is partly based on existing computational models, but also presents new ways of conceptualizing intrinsic motivation. We argue that this kind of computational typology might be useful for opening new avenues for research both in psychology and developmental robotics.},

  abstract      = {This work builds upon previous efforts in online incremental learning, namely the Incremental Gaussian Mixture Network (IGMN). The IGMN is capable of learning from data streams in a single-pass by improving its model after analyzing each data point and discarding it thereafter. Nevertheless, it suffers from the scalability point-of-view, due to its asymptotic time complexity of O(NKD 3) for N data points, K Gaussian components and D dimensions, rendering it inadequate for high-dimensional data. In this work, we manage to reduce this complexity to O(NKD 2) by deriving formulas for working directly with precision matrices instead of covariance matrices. The final result is a much faster and scalable algorithm which can be applied to high dimensional tasks. This is confirmed by applying the modified algorithm to high-dimensional classification datasets.},

  year     = {2019},
  abstract = {A medical student learning to perform a laparoscopic procedure as well as a recently paralyzed user of a powered wheelchair must learn to operate machinery via interfaces that translate their actions into commands for the external device. Mathematically, we describe this type of learning as a deterministic dynamical process, whose state is the evolving forward and inverse internal models of the interface. The forward model predicts the outcomes of actions while the inverse model generates actions designed to attain desired outcomes. Both the mathematical analysis of learning dynamics and the performance observed in a group of subjects demonstrate first-order exponential convergence of the learning process toward a particular state that depends only on the initial inverse and forward models and on the supplied sequence of targets. Noise is not only present but necessary for the convergence of learning through the minimization of the difference between actual and predicted outcomes. Author summary Several studies have suggested that as we learn a new skill our brain forms representations, or “internal models”, of the skill and of the environment in which we operate. Theories of motor learning postulate that the brain builds forward models that predict the sensory consequences of motor commands, and inverse models that generate successful commands from planned movements. We test this hypothesis taking advantage of a special interface that generates a novel relation between the subject’s actions and the position of a cursor on a computer monitor, thus allowing subjects to control an external device by movements of their body. We recorded the motions of the body and of the cursor, and obtained estimates of both forward and inverse models. We followed how these estimates evolved in time as subjects practiced and acquired a new skill. We found that the description of learning as a simple deterministic process driven by the sequence of targets is sufficient to capture the observed convergence to a single solution of the inverse model among an infinite variety of alternative possibilities. This work is relevant to the study of fundamental learning mechanisms as well as to the design of intelligent interfaces for people with paralysis.},

Multiple paired forward inverse models describing how diverse objects and environments can be controlled and learned separately have recently been proposed. The ‘minimum variance model’ is another major recent advance in the computational theory of motor control.

In this manner one can quickly acquire a large amount of training data representing the body shape. We compare three approaches to track the common contact point observed when one robot arm is touching the other in a bimanual setup: feed-forward control, solely relying on a CAD-based kinematics, performs worst; a controller that is only based on tactile feedback typically lacks behind; only the combination of both approaches yields satisfactory results. As a first, preliminary application, we use the self-touch capability to calibrate the closed kinematic chain formed by both arms touching each other. The obtained homogeneous transform describing the relative mounting pose of both arms, improves end-effector position estimations by a magnitude compared to a traditional, vision-based approach.},

  abstract = {Abstract Accurate models of mechanical system dynamics are often critical for model-based control and reinforcement learning. Fully data-driven dynamics models promise to ease the process of modeling and analysis, but require considerable amounts of data for training and often do not generalize well to unseen parts of the state space. Combining data-driven modeling with prior analytical knowledge is an attractive alternative as the inclusion of structural knowledge into a regression model improves the model's data efficiency and physical integrity. In this article, we survey supervised regression models that combine rigid-body mechanics with data-driven modeling techniques. We analyze the different latent functions (such as kinetic energy or dissipative forces) and operators (such as differential operators and projection matrices) underlying common descriptions of rigid-body mechanics. Based on this analysis, we provide a unified view on the combination of data-driven regression models, such as neural networks and Gaussian processes, with analytical model priors. Furthermore, we review and discuss key techniques for designing structured models such as automatic differentiation.},

  abstract = {{This paper presents a general algorithm for solving the dynamic of tree structure robots with rigid and flexible links, active and passive joints, and with a fixed or floating base. The algorithm encompasses in a unified approach both the inverse and direct dynamics. It addresses also the hybrid case where each active joint is considered with known joint torque as in the direct dynamic case, or with known joint acceleration as in the inverse dynamic case. To achieve this goal, we propose an efficient recursive approach based on the generalized Newton–Euler equations of flexible tree-structure systems. This new general hybrid algorithm is easy to program either numerically or using efficient customized symbolic techniques. It is of great interest for studying floating base systems with soft appendages as those currently investigated in soft bio-inspired robotics or when a robotic system has to modify its structure for some particular tasks, such as transforming an active joint into a compliant flexible one, or modifying a task with a floating base into one with fixed base.}},

Therefore, in practice, decisions are made based on partial information about the ground truth network. It is of great interest to have metrics to determine if an inferred network (the partial information network) is similar to the ground truth. In this paper we develop a test for similarity between the inferred and the true network. Our research utilizes a network visualization tool, which systematically discovers a network, producing a sequence of snapshots of the network. We introduce and test our metric on the consecutive snapshots of a network, and against the ground truth. To test the scalability of our metric we use a random matrix theory approach while discovering Erdös-Rényi graphs. This scaling analysis allows us to make predictions about the performance of the discovery process.},

The proprioceptive information used by current artificial agents (robots) is mainly related to posture (and its change) and consists of joint angles (joint velocities) given a linked structure. However, the counterpart in biological agents (humans and other animals) includes more complicated components with associated controversies concerning the relationship between the body schema and the body image. A new trend of constructive approaches has been attacking this topic using computational models and robots. This chapter provides an overview of the biology of proprioception and body representation, summarizes the classical use of body schema in robotics, and describes a series of constructive approaches that address some of the mysteries of body representation.}},

The type of information that it represents? The way this information is represented? Or the function of the representation? And is there more than one type of body schema? There is a sense indeed in which the term ‘body schema’ is ambiguous, in that it functions as a general term that groups together various body representations intervening at different stages in motor control, representing short- or long-term properties, used for positive or negative affordances. In addition, one might want to distinguish between local body schemata, which represent body parts, and a global body schema, which represents the body as a whole. But is this latter holistic representation really necessary? Here this chapter will present a detailed characterization of the manifold of representational processes involved in what we commonly refer to as the body schema, as well as the key mechanisms that contribute to their construal.}},

In particular, the role of the embodiment for the behavior of both artificial and natural beings has become of much and increasing interest in recent times. In robotics, there are essentially two attitudes towards the physical embodiment. On the one hand, with rule based systems and/or systems intended to execute a given motion plan, embodiment is more or less considered as a (nasty) problem opposing the execution of the plan. On the other hand, it is well believed and verified by many examples that living beings are taking much advantage from the physico-mechanical properties of their bodies in order to create natural motion patterns.},

This systematic review aimed to identify clinically related tools to measure proprioceptive acuity, to classify the construct(s) underpinning the tools, and to report on the clinimetric properties of the tools. We searched key databases with the pertinent search terms, and from an initial list of 935 articles, we identified 57 of relevance. These articles described 32 different tools or methods to quantify proprioception. There was wide variation in methods, the joints able to be tested, and the populations sampled. The predominant construct was active or passive joint position detection, followed by passive motion detection and motion direction discrimination. The clinimetric properties were mostly poorly evaluated or reported. The Rivermead Assessment of Somatosensory Perception was generally considered to be a valid and reliable tool but with low precision; other tools with higher precision are potentially not clinically feasible. Clinicians and clinical researchers can use the summary tables to make more informed decisions about which tool to use to match their predominant requirements. Further discussion and research is needed to produce measures of proprioception that have improved validity and utility.},

To have RCMM achieve its highest possible accuracy, a trio of calibrations are introduced. In order for the robot to use a vision system to measure the 3D pose of an object relative to its own base, it is necessary to know the relative position and orientation between the hand and the robot base (robot kinematic calibration), between the eye and the hand (TCP calibration), and between the object and the eye (sensor calibration). For a laser sensor based robot vision system we have addressed its component vision system in previous chapters. We discussed the formation and calibration of the vision system and calibration of its TCP position. Robot calibration is a natural extension of TCP calibration.},

This article proposes a calibration method for robot kinematic parameters based on the drawstring displacement sensor. Firstly, the kinematic error model for articulated robot is established. Based on such a model, the position measurement system consisting of four drawstring displacement sensors is used to measure the actual position of the robot end-effector. Then, the deviation of the kinematic parameters of the robot is identified by the least-squares method according to robot end-effector deviations. The Cartesian space compensation method is adopted to improve the absolute positioning accuracy of the robot end-effecter. By experiments on the EFORT ER3A robot, the absolute positioning accuracy of the robot is significantly improved after calibration, which shows the effectiveness of the proposed method.},
