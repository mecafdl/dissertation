The thesis is structured as follows.
Chapter \ref{ch:foundations} provides the theoretical foundations for tactile skills, their synthesis from formal process definitions, the taxonomy of manipulation skills, skill learning, and planning.
Chapter \ref{ch:architecture} introduces the \skillmodelabbr{} framework and its implementation, the \software{} (\softwareabbr{}).
Furthermore, it presents numerous validation experiments such as related publications and demonstrators shown at public events that verify the overall learning architecture.
In Ch. \ref{ch:experiments} the theoretical foundations are experimentally validated using the architecture.
It presents experiments and results from skill synthesis, skill learning, transfer learning, and assembly planning.
Finally, Ch. \ref{ch:conclusion} concludes the thesis and gives an outlook on future work.
