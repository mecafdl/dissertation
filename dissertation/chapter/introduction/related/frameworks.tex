There exist many robot frameworks, also specifically for learning.
An early attempt at an open-source, community-driven framework is orocos \cite{bruyninckx2001open}.
One of the most popular and widespread ones is the Robot Operating System (ROS) \cite{quigley2009ros}.
Its principle is to have nodes that communicate in the network with a publisher / subscriber mechanism.
It is highly flexible and offers a vast library of user-generated content for various applications and hardware systems.
It currently is about to be replaced by its successor, ROS2 \cite{maruyama2016exploring} which has similar design principles but has a much higher performance.
There are several meta frameworks that build on ROS, such as \cite{chitta2017ros_control} that provides real-time capabilities, or \cite{li2016alliance} that adapts ROS for multi-robot systems specifically.

There is a variety of smaller, and usually more specialized, frameworks.
ArmarX is designed to program humanoid robots with a rich toolset \cite{vahrenkamp2015robot}.
\cite{muratore2017xbotcore} introduces XBotCore, a real-time capable robot control framework for EtherCat-based robots and software middleware, that satisfies hard real-time requirements.
\cite{beetz2018know} presents the KnowRob2 framework that is designed for knowledge processing and reasoning.
