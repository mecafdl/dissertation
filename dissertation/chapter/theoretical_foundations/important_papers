o Literature review

> IDEAS: 
	- Deep learning requires prohibitive amounts of data that need to be collected to physical interaction.
	- Deep learning is good for interpolation but hardly perfoms correctly outiside the traning data (poor generalization, no extrapolation capabilities)
	- When combinging physics based modeling with machine learning, structural knowledge improves generalization, reduces sample complexity, and prevents overfitting to spurious correlations
	- Black, gray, and white box models
	- Motivate the use of a specific type of gradient descent technique. Needs a comparison with simulations.
	- Introduce the notion of sensorimotor contingencies as part of the model
	- Discuss the benefits of using force-torque sensors
	- Rephrase: "In order to generalize the learned models to a larger state space and to adapt the models for time-dependent changes, online learning of such models is necessary."
	- Rephrase: " the role that the body plays in shaping the mind, suggesting that intelligent behavior emerges out of the interplay between the brain, body and physical environment"
	- Rephrase: "The advantage of self-learned models is that they can be used without specific prior knowledge about the robot, for example its morphology or pre-defined forward and inverse models."
	- Forward models are used for prediction, inverse models are used for control
	- Unlike the circle point analys,  in which the motion of single joint in isolation is observed, using Cartesian variables (body velocity and acceleration) the parameters of the kinemati chain
	  can be learned
	- Tactile sensors complement proprioception (somatosensatoion) to extend the richness of he body morphology that can be inferred only from proprioception. However, touch and vision are not strictly
	  necessary to learn the morphology of the robot and are, naturaly, irrelevant for inertial parameter learning
	- Rephrase: "Improving the ability of robots to make predictions is a promising direction to enhance their skills, not only on motor control and prediction of their own body"
	- Rephrase: " Well-established learning systems for motor prediction and control [2–4] are built on internal models, namely forward and inverse models."
	- Rephrase: "The advantage of self-learned models is that they can be used without specific prior knowledge about the robot, for example its morphology or pre-defined forward and inverse models. This
                     information might be unavailable in some cases, such as in soft robotics or after a mechanical damage. Self-learned models can enable robots to learn on their own how to behave in those
                     circumstances [16,17]."
        - Rephrase: "In developmental robotics, such models are acquired
                     by designing learning mechanisms to let a robot build its own
                     perceptive and behavioral repertoire. The focus is to investigate
                     the acquisition of motor skills from sensorimotor interaction
                     with the environment [30]. As a result, the developmental approach aims to endow robots with all the learning capabilities
                     that may be necessary to build rich and flexible sensorimotor representations [31]"
	- Use Hart's thesis and Matej's work to introduce and define the concept of body schema
	- Discuss the relevance of body models, use Matej's paper to aid the discussion of the differnt type of models. Migrate to inverse dynamics models and kinematic calibration
	  to then introduce the robotic body schema
	- In the last decade, end-toend learning approaches have taken predominance,yet, recently the notion of introducing structure to improve generalization and sample efficiency has appeared
	- Rephrase: "... learning an inverse dynamics model once is not enough as the robot’s dynamics changes while interacting with the real world. Instead, the dynamics models need to be adapted
	  at run-time"
	- Rephrase: " In order to take full advantage of a learning approach, online learning is absolute necessity as it allows the adaption to changes in the robot dynamics, load or the actuators"
	- Nonparametric regression models: LWPR, GPR, and SVR	  
	- On-line adaptation of models is a valuable strategy because it can capture non-stationarities in the mechanical properties of the plant.
	- Rephrase: "Two approaches in that respect are the on-line parameter identification step of adaptive control [5], which tunes parameters of a given model given its mechanical structure [6] and model
	   learning, which identifies mechanical models using supervised learning methods without any knowledge of the structure."
	- Rephrase: "In traditional robotics, the importance of learning the mapping between different sensory modalities is often neglected. The robot geometry is generally assumed to be known, and the
	  sensor properties are acquired offline, via a calibration process"
	- Rephrase: "learning the sensorimotor contingencies is likely to bring significant advantages, as it amounts to a continuous self-calibration. "
	- Discuss this: As mentioned by Hersch et al. "(Subjective body schema) Traditionally, the body schema has been considered as an objective account of the body characteristics, such as the
	  arrangement of the limbs, their lengths or the positioning and effect of the joints. It is possible to oppose this “objective” body schema with a “subjective” view of the body schema, which would
	  be dependent on the perceptual abilities of the robot. In this view, which is adopted in this paper, the body schema deals only indirectly with physical properties of the body. It primarily deals
	  with the FOR transformations associated with the sensory signals. For example, given a proprioceptive input corresponding to a particular posture, the body schema can predict the corresponding
	  visual perception. This depends not only on the physical properties of the body but also on the properties of the sensory system. Moreover, it can be that a precise account of the physical
	  properties of the body is not necessary for the “subjective body schema,” depending on the sensory system. For example, in our case, if the robot can track only end-effector positions,
	  many different body geometries will yield the same “subjective” body schema"
	- The replay buffer with reservoir sampling helps preserving a representative set of samples from the state space (yes?)
	- Cite work of Khalil on modeling robots with floating bases and flexible links and the work of humanoids with SO3 joints to motivate how the conventional representations can be leveraged to
	  model more complex kinematic trees
	- The ecological or sensorimotor self is the same as the body schema

           GENERAL WORKS ON DYNAMICS MODEL LEARNING
===================================================================
NOTE: the following two works should be mentioned together
* Model learning for robot control: a survey
	- "direct modeling approach, the model is learned directly from the observations"
	- direct model learning is used for forward and inverse dynamics learning
	- Classical methods include, regression techniques, neural networks, and statistial approximation techniques
	- Challenges of real-world problems for machine learning, SEE TABLE 2

	- Perhaps nothing interesting to mention and should be removed

* Learning inverse dynamics models with contacts
	- Present a method for learning the inverse dynamics of humanoid robots including contacts
	- the method is a data-driven mixture-of-experts approach based on Gaussian processes
	- it uses proximal fore/torque sensing and a distributed tactile sensing without needing a spatially calibrated model

* Model learning with local gaussian process regression
	- propose a local approximation to the standard GPR, called local GPR (LGP), for real-time model online-learning by combining the high accuracy of GPR and the fast speed of LWPR
	- Gaussian Process Regression:  high computational load, not suitable for high dimensions
	- LWPR: not straight forward to implement, tuning of hyperparameters

===================================================================
		GENERAL TOPICS RELATED TO LEARNING
===================================================================
* A Review of Robot Learning for Manipulation: Challenges, Representations, and Algorithms
	- A robot, and whatever it interacts with is subject the laws of physics and the structure they impose
	- Interactive perception: the robot physically interacts with its environment to obtain a better estimate of it
	- Different actions result in different effects, faster learning by selecting informative actions


===================================================================
      KINEMATICS, SENSORIMOTOR AND BODY SCHEMA RELATED WORKS
===================================================================
* Robots that can adapt like animals
	- Cite this work as an example of the benefits that body knowledge would bring to body adaption

* Online body schema adaptation based on internal mental simulation and multisensory feedback
	- EXAMPLE OF USING VISUAL FEEDBACK
	- Presentes a novel system for simultaneous online body schema adaptation and end-effector pose estimation implemented on the iCub humanoid robot
	- Evidence in neuroscience suggests that the human brain keeps an updated representation of the body that is empled to generate hypothesis of the limbs positions in space, and combines this
	  hypothesis with the actual perception of the self in a Bayesian fashion

* Robot Self-Modeling (Justin W. Hart, MUST CITE)
	- EXAMPLE OF USING VISUAL FEEDBACK
	- Calibrates the kinematic structure of a robot use a variant of circle point analysis and using a motion capture system as reference
	- Discusses the terms physical self, ecological self, and body schema
	- Motivates why it is important to learn models of the body
	- "The understanding of the body, the senses, and their relationship to each other that is learned through this process is one of the
	   earliest forms of self-awareness to develop during infancy. Developmental theorists refer to this knowledge of the body and senses as knowledge of the ecological self [3].
	   The ecological self is the combination of the physical self as an object that can be controlled by one’s mind and the senses that take in information about this body and other physical objects."
	- See Introduction for more interesting ideas
* A Robotic Model of the Ecological Self
	- Results included in the above thesis

* Online learning of the body schema
	- EXAMPLE OF USING VISUAL FEEDBACK
	- Propose a mechanism by which a humanoid robot can learn its body schema through combining information from the proprioception (motor encoders), the stereovision and possibly tactile sensors
	- The body schema is modeled by a hierarchy of frames of reference (FOR) transformations which are continuously adapted as sensory information is acquired by the robot.
	- IMPORTANT: the kinematic learning method is similar to mine. The authors are also learning the location and orientation of the joint axes, expressed with the DH parametrization
	- IMPORTANT: Note that the structure of this tree (i.e. the number of joints and the ordering) is given and remains fixed. This is a main difference since in my case the mutual information reveals
          the mechanical topology
	- IMPORTANT: "We assume that the robot is endowed with a stereovision system that can track the position of its end-effectors. This position is provided in a head-centered FOR." This means that
	  they use exteroception!
	- Perhaps this work should be described in more detail when cited on the thesis

* Multimodal representation models for prediction and control from partial information
	- a multimodal variational autoencoder is proposed to enable an iCub humanoid robot to learn representations of its sensorimotor capabilities from different sensor modalities. 
	-  implemented an architecture that allows a robot to predict visual trajectories of other agents’ actions by using only self-learned internal models

* Predictive learning: its key role in early cognitive development

* Sensorimotor Representation Learning for an “Active Self” in Robots: A Model Survey
	- This work discussed models for endow robots with bio-inspired capacities that emulated the sensory representations of body schema, peripersonal space, and the active self in humans. 
	- Ensuring secure interactions between humans and robots necessitates robots having the capability to adapt their behavior appropriately in environments occupied by people. This involves addressing 		  the complexities of our dynamic and unorganized surroundings, rather than adhering to a fixed set of operational rules. In humans, these skills are believed to be associated with our capacity to
	  sense the spatial positioning of our body, perceive the locations of our limbs during motion, maintain awareness of other objects and entities, and purposefully manipulate our body parts to
	  interact with them.
	  
* Sensorimotor contingencies as a key drive of development: From babies to robots

* Body models in humans, animals, and robots
	- Robot body models are typically explicit, veridical, universal, centralized, and modular
	- Concepts including superficial and postural schema, body schema, body image, corporeal schema, etc. have been put forth. One characteristic common to all these representations is their multimodal
	  nature; they dynamically integrate information from different sensory modalities (visual, tactile, proprioceptive, vestibular, auditory)
	- sensorimotor body representation --used for action planning and control-- (body schema), visuspatial body representation (body structural description or physical self?)
	- long term "offline" representations, and short term "on-line" representations, updated from sensormotor afferent-efferent information
	- Body schema is multimodal
	- Automatic robot self-calibration is thus desired and solutions for this are being developed. For the robot to self-calibrate, it needs redundant sources of information about its body.
	  There is a growing number of powerful yet economic sensors for robots available (cameras, RGB-D cameras, inertial measurement units, force/torque sensors, tactile sensors) and
	  they can be exploited for calibration. Multimodality—another property of biological body representations—thus enables plasticity.


===================================================================
                   WORKS USING NEURAL NETWORKS
===================================================================
* Deep Lagrangian Networks: Using Physics as Model Prior for Deep Learning
	- Two deep NN are proposed to learn the inertia matrix and potential energy in the Euler-Lagrange formulation of the robot dynamics
	- Constraints on the symmetry and positiveness of the inertia matrix are imposed
	- Online learning is enforced
	- Can recover the contribution of the inertial-, gravitational and centripetal forces from sensor data

* Structured Mechanical Models for Robot Learning and Control
	- My impression is that this work is an extension to the Deep Lagrangian Networks and offers the idea that adding a NN to model the dissipative and input forces provides better performance
	- Can be grouped together with Deepl Lagrangian networks and Hamiltonean Neural Networks
	
* Combining physics and deep learning to learn continuous-time dynamics models (MUST INCLUDE)
	- An IJRR article that contains the Deep lagrangian paper, and further results 
	
* Body schema learning for robotic manipulators from visual self-perception (STURM, CITE)
	- EXAMPLE OF USING VISUAL FEEDBACK
	- Presents an approach to body schema learning and life-long body adaptation for a robotic manipulation system. Continuously learn a large set of local
	  kinematic models using nonparametric regression and searches for the best arrangement of these models to represent the full system
	  
* Online incremental learning of inverse dynamics incorporating prior knowledge
	- Prior knowledge is incorporated into the LWPR framework by initializing the local linear models with a first order approximation of the available prior information.

* Real-time deep learning of robotic manipulator inverse dynamics (Polydoros)
