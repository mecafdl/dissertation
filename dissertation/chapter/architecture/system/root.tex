This section presents a number of validation experiments in which \softwareabbr{} has been used as a platform.
Each experiment uses, besides the core software, different components, or was even the incentive the extend the software accordingly.
It is demonstrated how \softwareabbr{} and as a consequence the \skillmodelabbr{} framework and the concept of tactile skills have enabled further research work and publications in various related fields.
