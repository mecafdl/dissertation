This chapter describes the developed learning architecture that forms the basis for the experiments in Ch.~\ref{ch:experiments}.
Its main components are the \skillmodelabbr{} framework, a model for tactile skills, and \softwareabbr{}, the software stack that implements the \skillmodelabbr{} framework.
Finally, a number of challenging validation experiments underline the unprecedented performance of the developed framework.
