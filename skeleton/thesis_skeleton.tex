\section*{Abstract}

\subsection*{Vision}

\begin{itemize}
	\item For future robots, the seamless integration of the body schema stands as a foundational pillar that fosters learning, motor control, coordination, and advanced spatial awareness that improves their versatility and seamless interaction with their surroundings.

    \item As robots develop and steadily permeate many aspects of human life, they need actively engage in the exploration and development of models for their own bodies, i.e. autonomous self-discovery of their body schema.

	\item Inspired by humans, future robots should be able to skillfully employ their body schema for advanced locomotion and motion planning, precise grasping, intricate object manipulation, and to anticipate and adapt the interaction with other agents.
		
	\item Constant self-monitoring of the sensorimotor state and the internal body models becomes the norm for instantaneous error detection and correction. These models can adapt steadily to different situations developing a spatial awareness of the physical self that enables the rapid planning and deployment of contingent motion strategies providing advanced interaction capabilities with the environment.

    \item Robots will be self-sufficient to perform monitoring, calibration, and adaptation of their body representation relying only on onboard sensing capabilities. Fundamental modalities will include somatosensation (proprioception and touch) and vision.
 
	\item Understanding their own body structure enables robots to interact more effectively with other robots and with humans by adjusting movements for safety. Additionally, robots can optimize their energy consumption by adapting their motions based on physical properties, contributing to energy-aware robotics.

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Challenges}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Reliance on External Measurements:} Calibration and identification heavily depend on off-robot measurement devices, such as vision and motion-capturing systems, to discern kinematic structure properties. Despite various sensor signals from modern robots, determining the minimum set for constructing a body model based on robot sensing only remains unresolved.

    \item \textbf{Limitations of Current Robot Learning Approaches:} Many current local and global machine learning frameworks for physical systems exclude structural knowledge and suffer from limited generalization capabilities and low sample efficiency. Additionally, learning a robot's physical attributes parts from the assumption of a known mechanical topology and is often exclusive to calibration and offline parametric identification routines performed in controlled spaces (laboratories).

	\item \textbf{Challenges in Learning Methods:} Many alternative learning methods, like neural networks, lack information about the body structure and require substantial data. Designing neural networks presents challenges in determining topology, and most data-based methods suffer from generalization limitations, confining learning to specific input-output regions.

	\item \textbf{Research Gaps and Unifying Scheme:} There are significant gaps in research, including unclear understanding of how object handling extends the robotic body schema and limited exploration of the mechanical arrangement of joints and links (mechanical topology). Additionally, there is a lack of a unifying scheme to integrate all learning stages for a fully characterized robotic body schema solely from knowledge about sensorimotor signals. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Contribution}
%This work:
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item Consolidates the necessary and sufficient proprioceptive signal quantities (afferent and efferent sensory inputs and commands) that enable robots to autonomously acquire, monitor, and adapt knowledge about their body structure and decouple them from the need for exteroceptive off-body sensors.
%
%	% * NOTE: Computational graph that describes the learning of the kinematics and dynamics
%	% * NOTE: Connect this idea with the building architectures
%    \item Reformulates robot kinematic calibration and parametric robot system identification as a computational graph whose topology reflects a modular structure amenable to machine learning. The architecture of this graph is abstracted into a pipeline consisting of a sequence of online learning phases where streams of proprioceptive signals are merged with first-order principles, imposed by the system's embodiment, to enable the extraction of fundamental features of the robot body schema.
%
%%    \item \redtext{Demonstrates that essential properties of the body morphology of the broad class of tree-like floating base structures can be characterized by studying the relationships among a fundamental set of proprioceptive signals. First, the mechanical topology, i.e., the arrangement of links and joints, is inferred from proprioception using model-free information-theoretic measures.

%	\item Complements the description of the robot body schema by instantiating the fundamental inertial properties of the links composing the inferred morphology. Given that these properties lie on the Riemannian manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices, a method is introduced to learn them online while ensuring physical feasibility at all times.

	\item While acknowledging the undeniable versatility and representational power of current end-to-end learning approaches, this work incites to reconsider their naive application to physical systems and promote the assessment of their limitations when they deliberately exclude principled knowledge. In contrast, the arguments and findings presented here reveal avenues for machine learning frameworks for embodied systems. This research exposes the untapped potential arising from the synergistic integration of existing structural knowledge with data-driven method.
		
	\item The outlined concepts and methods demonstrate that crucial aspects of a robot's body schema can be deduced through a fundamental set of proprioceptive signals. As future mobile robots are anticipated to feature a diverse, enhanced, and reliable array of on-board sensing modalities, extending beyond proprioception, the findings discussed in this thesis serve as a catalyst for research into the integration of these modalities. This integration, coupled with the online learning of body morphological and dynamic properties, holds the promise of refining and adapting body models, ultimately empowering robots with heightened levels of autonomy.

	\item \redtext{This study contributes to an emerging research area that underscores building and maintaining a body schema as a crucial capability for embodied systems. Such a capability pertains robots characterized by conventional, immutable structures and a novel category of mechanical systems exhibiting dynamic morphologies and diverse multimodal sensory modalities. These systems will evolve their sense of self, recognizing the affordances inherent in their bodies.}.

\subsection*{Abstract (text version)}
\redtext{As robots become increasingly integral to human life, the imperative emerges for them to autonomously explore and construct models of their bodies. Robots should take cues from human capabilities, aspiring to build and utilize their body schema for advanced locomotion, finer manipulation, and adaptive interactions. Thus, a crucial foundation lies in seamlessly integrating the body schema to elevate learning, motor control, coordination, and spatial awareness. Furthermore, future robots should become self-sufficient entities that conduct monitoring, calibration, and adaptation exclusively through onboard sensing modalities. Standardizing constant self-monitoring nurtures spatial awareness and facilitates rapid error detection and correction. A profound understanding of their body structure will undoubtedly lead to enhanced, safe, and energy-aware interactions. However, current robot learning approaches encounter limitations, such as suboptimal generalization and sample efficiency, exhibiting a need for more structural knowledge. Versatile methods, like neural networks, confront challenges related to data and topology, confining learning to specific regions. On the other hand, learning robot physical attributes still rely on a presumed knowledge of the mechanical topology, often involving calibration and offline identification in controlled environments with a persistent reliance on external measurements, such as vision and motion-capturing systems. The research landscape generally reveals the lack of a unified framework that enables robots to build representations of their body schema to achieve improved body awareness and interaction capabilities. This study addresses these challenges by consolidating necessary and sufficient proprioceptive signal quantities, enabling robots to autonomously acquire knowledge about their body structure without relying on exteroceptive off-body sensors. It introduces an approach that reformulates robot kinematic calibration and system identification as a modular computational graph amenable to machine learning. This abstracted architecture, applied in online learning phases, seamlessly merges proprioceptive signals with first-order principles, extracting fundamental features of the robot body schema. Characterizing morphological properties of tree-like structures, the study infers mechanical topology through information-theoretic measures, validating and applying it independently of off-robot calibration. The research extends its scope by complementing the robot body schema by instantiating inertial properties, ensuring online learning and physical feasibility. Ultimately, this work challenges the uncritical application of end-to-end learning in physical systems, urging a reevaluation of its limitations when excluding principled knowledge. It underscores opportunities for machine learning frameworks in embodied systems, emphasizing the untapped potential of synergizing structural knowledge with data-driven methods. This study catalyzes future research in an incipient field that underscores building and maintaining a body schema by demonstrating that fundamental properties of a robot's morphology can be deduced from proprioceptive signals. Its implications are far-reaching, addressing the needs of conventional and dynamic robotic structures with diverse sensory modalities that require a more profound sense of self.}

%
%\subsection*{Points to address}
%In the ever-evolving landscape of robotics, a transformative paradigm is emerging â one where robots autonomously learn models of their own bodies. This monumental shift is not merely a technological advancement; it is a gateway to a future where robots seamlessly integrate into various facets of human life, revolutionizing the way they perceive, interact, and adapt to their surroundings.
%\begin{enumerate}
%	%\item As robots become increasingly integral to human life, the imperative emerges for them to autonomously explore and construct models of their bodies. 
%	\item As robots develop and steadily permeate many aspects of human life, they need actively engage in the exploration and development of models for their own bodies, i.e. autonomous self-discovery of their physical self. Awareness of the physical self empowers robots to integrate sensory information and motor control, establishing a foundational body schema. This, in turn, contributes to enhanced motor control, spatial awareness, and efficient learning, fostering adaptability and effective interaction in diverse environments.

Furthermore, bodily awareness will allow robots to anticipate and adapt the interaction with other robotic and human agents.
%	
%	\item A crucial foundation for future robots, lies in seamlessly integrating the body schema to foster learning, motor control, coordination, and advanced spatial awareness that improves their versatility and seamless interaction with their surroundings.
%	
%	% Standardizing constant self-monitoring nurtures spatial awareness and facilitates rapid error detection and correction
%	\item Future robots should become self-sufficient entities that conduct monitoring, calibration, and adaptation of their body representation exclusively through onboard sensing modalities. Fundamental modalities include somatosensation (proprioception and touch) and vision.
%

In robotics model learning, a pressing challenge is the prevalent oversight of incorporating crucial structural knowledge. Current efforts primarily concentrate on developing forward and inverse models, adopting either a global or local emphasis, often neglecting the nuanced integration of essential structural information \cite{NguyenTuong2011Modellearningrobot}. Challenges faced by prevalent machine learning frameworks include the limitations of global techniques like Gaussian process regression, influenced by the curse of dimensionality, and the sensitivity of local methods such as Locally Weighted Projection Regression to hyperparameters. Despite the growing computational power and data availability favoring end-to-end learning methods, deep learning in particular, the pervasive neglect of prior principled knowledge poses essential challenges. Determining dedicated neural network architectures remains elusive \cite{Baker2017Designingneuralnetwork,Elsken2019Neuralarchitecturesearch}. Similarly, deep learning approaches, like other learning techniques, grapple with issues of low sample efficiency, extensive training times, and limited generalization, emphasizing the need for a balance between data-driven and knowledge-driven approaches within the field \cite{Pierson2017Deeplearningrobotics,Suenderhauf2018limitspotentialsdeep}.

Parting from the need for structure in robot model learning, \redtext{this dissertation addresses the problem of inferring essential morphological properties of the broad class of tree-like floating base structures that emulate the development of a body schema.} Similar efforts have been discussed in cognitive robotics, emphasizing the pivotal role of developing and maintaining internal body models for embodied systems. Indeed, enhanced understanding of the physical self through developing and integrating a body schema improves spatial awareness, motor control, and adaptability \cite{Nguyen2021Sensorimotorrepresentationlearning,Hoffmann2010Bodyschemarobotics}. \redtext{Yet, consensus is missing on what constitutes the body schema for a robot. Several existing endeavors in learning a body schema in robotics center exclusively in learning the particulars of the kinematic structure and predominantly rely on (off-body) vision \cite{Hersch2008Onlinelearningbody,MartinezCantin2010Bodyschemaacquisition,Hart2011roboticmodelecological,Lipson2019Taskagnosticself,Chen2022Fullybodyvisual,Sturm2009Bodyschemalearning}.} Alternative efforts lay their focus on exploring the sensorimotor associations between proprioceptive, tactile and visual sensory modalities \cite{Fuke2007BodyImageConstructed,Malinovska2022connectionistmodelassociating,Nguyen2019Reachingdevelopmentvisuo,Pugach2019BrainInspiredCoding,Lanillos2016Yieldingselfperception} but \redtext{provide limited insights into the robot's embodiment, in particular its physical structure}.

Classical robotics provides conventional methods for identifying the physical attributes of robots, typically assuming a known mechanical topology. Established techniques, such as conventional calibration routines \cite{Hollerbach1996CalibrationIndexTaxonomy} and offline system identification methods \cite{Swevers2007Dynamicmodelidentification,LeboutetInertialParameterIdentification}, have proven effective for known kinematic structures in controlled environments. However, these methods encounter challenges when applied to floating base robots, where standardization in identification procedures is lacking \cite{Ayusawa2014Identifiabilityidentificationinertial,Lee2022OptimizedSystemIdentification}. Importantly, \redtext{these conventional methods were not originally designed for integration into online learning frameworks}. While in addition to kinematic calibration classic robotics tackles forward and inverse kinematics problems, \redtext{it provides limited insights into a comprehensive understanding of the mechanical arrangement of joints and links, referred to as the mechanical topology.} Circling back to cognitive robotics, only a limited number of studies have approached the latter problem as a means to enhance self-modeling and monitoring, yet again depending on exteroceptive vision \cite{Bongard2006Automatedsynthesisbody,Bongard2006Resilientmachinescontinuous}. Last, be it the black-box machine learning, cognitive, or classical robotics paradigms, there is a strong dependence on external devices like cameras and motion-capturing systems, neglecting on-robot sensing. Despite modern robots having various sensor signals, determining the minimum set for constructing a body model solely from on-robot sensing remains unresolved.

In summary, research in model learning for robotics reveals critical gaps hindering the construction and understanding of a comprehensive robot body schema. There needs to be a clear definition for the robotic schema and a method for its construction, coupled with the challenge of determining a fundamental set of proprioceptive and (on-body) exteroceptive signals essential for constructing a body schema, underscores the current limitations. Integrating cutting-edge machine learning techniques with prior information and first-order principles from mechanics offers a promising avenue to address challenges in data requirements, enhance generalization capabilities, and gain deeper insights into body structure and properties. However, limited exploration into the mechanical topology, a lack of synergy between engineering approaches and online learning for realizing a first robot body schema, and the absence of a unifying scheme defining relevant learning stages remain notable gaps. Furthermore, the intricate connections between sensorimotor regularities and body structural knowledge in robotics remain poorly understood, necessitating methods with plasticity to adapt to different motion policies and accurately reflect these effects. Addressing these gaps is crucial for advancing the field of robotics, enabling the development of more sophisticated and adaptable embodied systems.

%This research aims to address identified challenges and gaps in existing machine learning frameworks for model learning in robotics, emphasizing the nuanced integration of structural knowledge. Furthermore, it seeks to advance the understanding of robot physical attributes, specifically focusing on the mechanical topology, proposing innovative methodologies beyond conventional calibration and system identification. The investigation extends into the realm of learning the physical self and the body schema, exploring modalities beyond vision and tactile inputs. By doing so, this research endeavors to bridge the identified gaps, fostering the development of more robust and adaptive robotic systems in diverse environments.

%Research in model learning for robotics reveals several critical gaps that impede progress in understanding and constructing a comprehensive robot body schema. Firstly, there exists no clear definition of what constitutes the robotic schema, and the methodology for its construction remains elusive. Additionally, despite the wealth of proprioceptive and exteroceptive signals provided by modern robots, determining a fundamental set essential for constructing a body schema is yet to be established. The integration of state-of-the-art machine learning techniques with existing information and first-order principles from mechanics in the development of efficient learning algorithms for embodied systems presents a promising avenue for addressing challenges in data requirements, enhancing generalization capabilities, and gaining deeper insights into body structure and properties. However, limited exploration into the mechanical arrangement of joints and links, known as the mechanical topology, remains a notable gap in current research.
%
%Furthermore, the potential synergy between engineering approaches for system identification and modern online learning techniques to realize a first robot body schema has not been extensively explored. A unifying scheme that defines relevant learning stages and their integration to produce a robot body schema from knowledge about sensorimotor signals and first-order principles, capturing essential properties of the robot body (physical self), is lacking. Despite the consensus on the crucial role of embodiment in shaping relationships among sensorimotor signals, the connections between sensorimotor regularities and body structural knowledge in robotics are poorly understood. Addressing this gap requires a method that not only acknowledges the variability in statistical properties of signals but also demonstrates plasticity to adapt to different motion policies and accurately reflects these effects, as highlighted by recent works \cite{Geist2021Structuredlearningrigid, Lutter2023Combiningphysicsdeep, Jacquey2019Sensorimotorcontingenciesas}. Closing these research gaps is essential for advancing the field of robotics and developing more sophisticated and adaptable embodied systems

Calibration and identification processes in robotics rely extensively on off-robot measurement devices, including vision, laser metrology, and motion-capturing systems, to discern properties related to the kinematic structure. This strong dependence on external measurements underscores the complexity of achieving accurate calibration and identification through on-robot sensing alone. Moreover, despite the availability of various sensor signals from modern robots, the challenge of determining the minimum set required for constructing a body model based solely on robot sensing remains unresolved.

In the realm of robotics, there is a burgeoning research area emphasizing the development and maintenance of internal body models as a crucial capability for embodied systems, running parallel to current model learning and conventional system identification approaches.

However, very few works have delved into the need to learn the mechanical topology of the robot and the potential advantages it might bring \cite{Bongard2006Automatedsynthesisbody,Bongard2006Resilientmachinescontinuous}. 

In the evolving landscape of robotics, a critical research gap exists, centering around the development and maintenance of internal body models. This area is gaining prominence alongside current model learning and traditional system identification approaches. Learning the physical self and cultivating a body schema are recognized as pivotal for robotics, enhancing spatial awareness, motor control, and adaptability. Despite recent remarkable achievements in learning a body schema for robots, these efforts primarily lean on (off-body) vision, with limited exploration of other modalities such as tactile inputs. While some works integrate vision and tactile input or consider the combined use of various sensory modalities, there is a notable scarcity of studies delving into the need to learn the mechanical topology of robots and the potential advantages it might offer. Understanding the intricacies of the robot's physical structure, beyond sensory data, remains an underexplored frontier in the pursuit of advancing embodied systems. Bridging this research gap is crucial for the holistic development of robots with enhanced spatial intelligence and adaptive capabilities in diverse environments.

The body schema, functioning as a dynamic map, enables precise movements and facilitates efficient learning, allowing robots to navigate diverse environments effectively \cite{Hoffmann2010Bodyschemarobotics}. While recent achievements in learning a body schema for robots have been remarkable, they predominantly rely on (off-body) vision \cite{Hersch2008Onlinelearningbody,MartinezCantin2010Bodyschemaacquisition,Hart2011roboticmodelecological,Lipson2019Taskagnosticself,Chen2022Fullybodyvisual}, with some works incorporating tactile inputs \cite{Li2015Towardsbodyschema,Zenha2018Incrementaladaptationrobot,Gama2021Goaldirectedtactile}. Few efforts explore combinations of modalities, such as vision and tactile input \cite{Fuke2007BodyImageConstructed}, somatosensation (proprioception and touch) \cite{Malinovska2022connectionistmodelassociating}, and consideration of all these modalities together \cite{Nguyen2019Reachingdevelopmentvisuo,Pugach2019BrainInspiredCoding,Lanillos2016Yieldingselfperception}. However, very few works have delved into the need to learn the mechanical topology of the robot and the potential advantages it might bring \cite{Bongard2006Automatedsynthesisbody,Bongard2006Resilientmachinescontinuous}.

\textcolor{blue}{In the evolving landscape of robotics, there exists a critical research gap that centers around the development and maintenance of internal body models, an area gaining prominence alongside current model learning and traditional system identification approaches. Learning the physical self and cultivating a body schema are recognized as pivotal for robotics, enhancing spatial awareness, motor control, and adaptability. Despite recent remarkable achievements in learning a body schema for robots, these efforts primarily lean on (off-body) vision, with limited exploration of other modalities such as tactile inputs. While some works integrate vision and tactile input or consider the combined use of various sensory modalities, there is a notable scarcity of studies delving into the need to learn the mechanical topology of robots and the potential advantages it might offer. Understanding the intricacies of the robot's physical structure, beyond sensory data, remains an underexplored frontier in the pursuit of advancing embodied systems. Bridging this research gap is crucial for the holistic development of robots with enhanced spatial intelligence and adaptive capabilities in diverse environments.}


\begin{itemize}
			

	\item \textbf{Challenges and limitations of current learning Approaches:}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Most of recent model learning endeavors in the robotics research has, unfortunately, excluded consideration of structural knowledge and rather centered around learning forward and inverse models with global or local focus \cite{NguyenTuong2011Modellearningrobot}.
		\item Standard global machine learning techniques like Gaussian process regression suffer from the course of dimensionality and rapidly become computationally intractable, alternative local methods such as Locally Weighted Projection Regression (and support vector regression) exhibit high sensitivity to hyperparameters and problematic generalization.
		\item The rise in computational power and the availability of data has brought end-to-end learning methods to prominence. With deep learning as the flagship, these global methods have lead to remarkable results. Yet, they have had the unwanted effect of making deliberately neglecting prior principled knowledge more widespread.
		\item In spite the prowess and potentials of deep learning approaches, such exclusion of available prior knowledge makes it difficult to determine dedicated neural networks architectures (number of nodes and layers, connectivity, and activation functions) \cite{Baker2017Designingneuralnetwork,Elsken2019Neuralarchitecturesearch} but, just like other learning techniques, deep learning approaches they still face problems related to the high demands of data to train (low sample efficiency), extensive training times, and performance that is tied to the training data, i.e. challenged generalization \cite{Pierson2017Deeplearningrobotics,Suenderhauf2018limitspotentialsdeep}.
		\item In general, most data-driven learning methods suffer from generalization limitations, confining learning to specific input-output regions.
		
	\end{enumerate}	
	
    \item \textbf{Limitations of conventional system identification:} 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The learning of a robot's physical attributes parts from the assumption of a known mechanical topology and is often exclusive to calibration routines for known kinematic structures \cite{Hollerbach1996CalibrationIndexTaxonomy} and conventional offline system identification methods performed in controlled spaces (laboratories). \cite{Swevers2007Dynamicmodelidentification,LeboutetInertialParameterIdentification}.
		\item In contrast to the conventional identification processes for fixed-base robots, the procedures for floating base robots are not as standardized \cite{Ayusawa2014Identifiabilityidentificationinertial,Lee2022OptimizedSystemIdentification}.    	
		\item Besides kinematic calibration and standard inverse kinematics problems, classical robotics research offers limited insights on learning the mechanical arrangement of joints and links that define the essence of the kinematic chain, known as the mechanical topology.

	\end{enumerate}
		
	\item \textbf{Reliance on External Measurements:}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item  Calibration and identification heavily depend on off-robot measurement devices, such as vision and motion-capturing systems, to discern kinematic structure properties. Despite various sensor signals from modern robots, determining the minimum set for constructing a body model based on robot sensing only remains unresolved.	
		\item There is a strong dependence on off-robot measurement devices for calibration and identification, commonly involving exteroceptive measurements like vision, laser metrology, and motion-capturing systems, to determine the properties of the kinematic structure.	
	\end{enumerate}	
	
	
	\item \textbf{Inference of body knowledge}:
	\begin{itemize}
		% "Building computational self-models of robot bodies that capture the entire body morphology and kinematics without prior knowledge of the body configurations is a key challenge"  \cite{Chen2022Fullybodyvisual}
		\item In parallel to the current model learning and conventional system identification approaches there is a relatively young research area that underscores building and maintaining internal body models as a crucial capability for embodied systems
		\item Learning the physical self and developing a body schema are pivotal for robotics, enhancing spatial awareness, motor control, and adaptability \cite{Nguyen2021Sensorimotorrepresentationlearning}. The body schema serves as a dynamic map, enabling precise movements and fostering efficient learning. As robots encounter diverse environments, their adaptive body schema allows them to navigate real-world scenarios effectively \cite{Hoffmann2010Bodyschemarobotics}. 

		\item Recent remarkable achievements towards learning a body schema for robots have been made, yet the are strongly dependent bur depend on (off-body) vision \cite{Hersch2008Onlinelearningbody,MartinezCantin2010Bodyschemaacquisition,Hart2011roboticmodelecological,Lipson2019Taskagnosticself,Chen2022Fullybodyvisual,Sturm2009Bodyschemalearning}
		\item Some other works require tactile inputs\cite{Li2015Towardsbodyschema,Zenha2018Incrementaladaptationrobot,Gama2021Goaldirectedtactile}
		\item Few efforts explore combinations of these modalities, like the combination of vision and tactile input\cite{Fuke2007BodyImageConstructed}, somatosensation (proprioception and touch)\cite{Malinovska2022connectionistmodelassociating}, and the consideration of all these modalities \cite{Nguyen2019Reachingdevelopmentvisuo,Pugach2019BrainInspiredCoding,Lanillos2016Yieldingselfperception}


		\item As stressed in current works \cite{Chen2022Fullybodyvisual}, and in spite of the very much desired distributed and multimodal properties of a body schema, in robotics it is certainly relevant to capture the body morphology.
		\item Very few works have even contemplated the need to learn the mechanical topology of the robot and the advantages it might bring \cite{Bongard2006Automatedsynthesisbody,Bongard2006Resilientmachinescontinuous}
	\end{itemize}	
	
	
	\item \textbf{Research Gaps:}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item No clear definition of what the robotic schema is and how to construct it
		
		\item Among the various proprioceptive and exteroceptive signals provided by modern robots' sensor suites, the determination of a fundamental set necessary to construct a body schema is yet to be established.		
		
		%\item For embodied systems, the integration of state-of-the-art machine learning techniques with available prior information  and well-established first-order principles from mechanics for more effective and efficient learning algorithms remains an area with many opportunities for development that can alleviate data needs, enhance generalization capabilities, and simultaneously provide more information about the body structure and its properties. Only recently, have interesting insights \cite{Geist2021Structuredlearningrigid} and works \cite{Lutter2023Combiningphysicsdeep} appeared that address this in depth.
		
		\item Identifying crucial research challenges in robotics involves delving into the integration of cutting-edge machine learning techniques with existing prior information and well-established first-order principles from mechanics, aiming to develop more effective and efficient learning algorithms for embodied systems. This area presents numerous opportunities for development, offering potential solutions to address data requirements, improve generalization capabilities, and gain deeper insights into body structure and properties. Recent contributions, such as the insightful work by Geist et al. \cite{Geist2021Structuredlearningrigid} and the comprehensive study by Lutter et al. \cite{Lutter2023Combiningphysicsdeep}, have started to address these challenges in depth, shedding light on promising avenues for advancement in robotics research.
		
				
		%\item Despite the recognized significance of frameworks that capture structural properties of physical systems.

		\item Unclear understanding of how object handling extends the robotic body schema
		
		\item Limited exploration of the mechanical arrangement of joints and links (mechanical topology).

		\item Leveraging engineering approaches for system identification and modern online learning techniques to provide a first realized robot body schema has not been extensively explored.

		\item There is a lack of a unifying scheme that narrows the gap to define the relevant learning stages and their corresponding integration required to produce a robot body schema from  knowledge about the sensorimotor signals and first-order principles that captures essential properties of the robot body (physical self).

		\item Despite the general consensus that embodiment plays a crucial role in shaping the relationships among sensorimotor signals, the connections between sensorimotor regularities and body structural knowledge in robotics remain poorly understood \cite{Jacquey2019Sensorimotorcontingenciesas}. A desired method addressing this gap should not only acknowledge the variability in statistical properties of signals but also demonstrate plasticity to adapt to different motion policies and accurately reflect these effects.

%		\item While there is a general consensus that embodiment shapes the relationships among sensorimotor signals, the connections between sensorimotor regularities and body structural knowledge in robotics are not well understood \cite{Jacquey2019Sensorimotorcontingenciesas}.
%		\item As the statistical properties of signals and their relationships may vary depending on the motion policy, a desired method should exhibit plasticity to reflect these effects.
		
	\end{enumerate}

%	\item \redtext{Additional points to consider:}
%	\begin{itemize}
%		\item \redtext{Exploration methodologies designed to collect data are inherently limited by the stringent requirement to ensure the safety of the robot and potential humans in proximity.}
%		\item \redtext{The understanding of how the handling and manipulation of objects extend the robotic body schema remains unclear.}

\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Overview of the Content}
The thesis discusses four main topics:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Model learning and body schema.} Introduction of the fundamentals of robotic calibration and system identification and their relation to the concept of body schema. The chapter elaborates on the different meanings of the body schema and the definition applying within the context of this thesis is provided. Finally the learning stages to characterize the robotic body schema from an engineering perspective are introduced and discussed.
	
	\item \textbf{Inferring the mechanical topology.} In this section, the concept of embodiment is presented and its significance to finding the robot structure is discussed. The fundamental idea that analyzing the relationships among the proprioceptive signals of a robot can convey information about the body structure as a result of embodiment is presented. Mutual information is pushed forward as a tool to unveil the mechanical topology of a robot given the right proprioceptive signals
	% Robots in the fiture can now learn things in the wild indepedent of calibration routines, self cointained identification
	
	% Deep understanding oh how to embed dynamics into the structzre of betwokrs
	
	% Accuracy and speed is shown on robots on a level that is equivalent of engineering approaches without the "chains" of conventional approaches. It shows true autonomy
	
	\item \textbf{Characterizing the kinematic structure.} This chapter extends the classical exteroception-based kinematic calibration methods with proprioception-based online learning. Departing from the conventional assumption that the mechanical topology is known, it is discussed how the combination of mutual information basic differential kinematic laws can be used to characterize the location and orientation of the robot joint axes.
	
	\item \textbf{Learning the inertial properties.} This section delves into the well established methods for robot inertial parameter identification and presents gradient-based online learning methods to produce valid sets of parameters. In particular the fundamental property that the inertial parameters lie on the manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices is exploited to present a Riemannian gradient descent method that operates on this manifold.
